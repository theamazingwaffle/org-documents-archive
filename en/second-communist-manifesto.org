#+TITLE: The Second Communist Manifesto

By Aleksei Borisovitch Razlatzki.

* Introduction (1999)

  "This little pamphlet is worth an entire volume!" This was how Lenin, in his
  time, assessed the *"Manifesto of the Communist Party"* by Marx and Engels.

  Before you, dear reader, is another such "little pamphlet" with a similar
  title, *"The Second Communist Manifesto."* We, the workers of the former
  Soviet Union, consider that it merits a similarly high assessment. We say this
  because, by rights, those fighting for the victory of the proletariat will be
  guided by the ideas of both Manifestos. We began our struggle more than 20
  years ago, in the depths of Brezhnevite medievalism, under the cruelest KGB
  inquisition. Our lot was to be driven underground, to endure arrests, prison
  and the gulag. This was our "reward" for continuous revolutionary agitation,
  propaganda, militant strikes and workers meetings. This is how things were
  under the absolute rule of the feudal CPSU. And this is how they continue to
  be under the semi-fascist regime of the "democrats," the young and rapacious
  bourgeoisie.

  Our own broad, practical work is itself a subject for Marxist analysis. Our
  experience, in particular, has many times confirmed the surprising truth, that
  "Marxism is the weapon of the proletariat and cannot be handed over to anyone
  else." And the teachings of Razlatzki are the Marxism of our times; thus it is
  most profoundly and completely understood and mastered by the
  proletariat. Outside the proletarian ranks, individuals drawn to this teaching
  are rare indeed.

  The prolonged, worldwide crisis of the worker's movement can be explained by a
  single cause; the most profound crisis of Marxism, the theoretical basis, the
  theoretical foundation of the worker's (please read: communist) movement. But
  the theoretical crisis cannot be overcome by the party, the International or
  the class. It is overcome only by the talent, the genius of individual
  people. Among the most prominent of these are Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and
  Mao Tse-Tung. Having departed this life ten years ago, Razlatzki belongs in
  the ranks of these giants.

  Yet you may ask, if these teachings merit such a high evaluation, and they
  have existed for twenty years already, where are their practical results?
  Please try to understand our answer.

  The complete and total failure of post-October socialism turned out to be so
  terrible, that in the world, and even in the USSR itself, it was simply
  impossible, right up to the end, to recognize how awful the situation of the
  Russian proletariat was. The principal role in this was played by our
  communist movement. Today appearing as the most evil, worst enemy of the
  proletariat and revolution, it, by means of its Jesuitical mimicry, (such as
  the CPSU and its successors) continues to deceive and make fools of the
  working class and society as a whole. If the open enemy of the working class,
  the bourgeoisie, conducts its struggle using the normal means of repression,
  then our "Marxists," Trotskyists, "communists" and other "friends" of the
  workers (here we must stress that we are speaking only about Russia and the
  former Soviet Union) have chosen a different path. Although they are enemies
  and frequently compete among themselves, they have, without discussion,
  organized an information blockade, a conspiracy of silence around the ideas of
  *"The Second Communist Manifesto,"* the like of which has never before been
  seen in history.

  Among us, the workers (as yet not in all Russia, but at least in the
  industrial heartland, the city of Samara) there is enormous hope for
  international proletarian solidarity. We believe that this truly
  counterrevolutionary conspiracy of silence surrounding the ideas of
  contemporary Marxism can be broken up thanks to the Internet and other
  communications media; that is to say with your help. One of the paradoxes of
  the current moment is that now, 20 years later, these ideas can be brought
  back to Russia, in order to launch the New October, *via the West.*

  We are happy for all those who take "The Second Communist Manifesto" to heart;
  we understand that this powerful, living well-spring of Marxist science will
  bowl you over.

  We must hurry, for no one knows how much time remains before Russia bursts
  apart in flames. It will be for the worse if the explosion of Russia is
  overwhelmed by spontaneity. This could rock the entire planet, which is
  already so very sick.

  One of the classics said, "The less you praise us, the more you can read us."
  Read Razlatzki!

  We envy you more than a little; you have started out on the right road. Before
  you lies the possibility of clearly and simultaneously seeing the past, the
  present and the future of humanity. So, the shape of the coming wave of
  proletarian revolution in the world depends greatly on you.

  *On behalf of the workers of Samara, and those who in one way or another have
  already sided with us:*

* Foreword

  The spectre of communism is again haunting Europe, and beyond! Yet it remains
  a spectre. More than century of history has propelled it across countries and
  continents but has not compelled it to materialize.

  Humanity has matured, it has stopped believing in witches and sprites, devils
  and ghosts. If, long ago, the spectre provoked fear and trembling in the
  bourgeoisie, now they occasionally like to scare the philistines with
  communism. Moreover, the spectres are multiplying. Now, with the help of
  countless philosophical tailors, even the most respectable bourgeois can dress
  up in translucent white garments and start hanging out with such foppish
  phantoms, one among many.[fn:1] And nobody can tell, any more, which is the
  genuine article.

  To the proletariat of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the
  word "communism" sounded like the word "hope." The year 1917 rang out like the
  peal of a bell that could be heard around the world. And in many countries,
  the bonfires of proletarian struggle burned, threatening to break out into the
  blaze of world revolution.

  What has changed since then?

  And the proletariat, where it did seize power with its own hands, where it
  established its hegemony, is it happy? And if so, then why is this happiness
  not very attractive to the rest.

  In the USSR, a country founded under the gaze of the whole workers movement,
  the dictatorship of the proletariat has been abolished. Does this signify the
  recognition by the proletariat of its own bankruptcy, its withdrawal from the
  ground it had conquered, its willingness to surrender? And to whom?

  Why do the economists of the Western world again and again return to the
  theory of convergence; the increasing similarity, the intrinsic drawing
  together of the socialist and capitalist countries?

  Why do the socialist countries not hurry to support these theoretical
  constructs? What is the essence of the iron curtain which continues to divide
  these worlds.

  In the mid twentieth century, contrary to all predictions, it is the most
  backward, underdeveloped countries that are the most revolutionary. Why?

  Because the proletariat of the advanced capitalist countries has not only been
  inclined to take up a belief in class harmony, but has almost voluntarily
  carried the whole burden of the economic crises of the second half of the
  twentieth century; whether it be the global financial crisis or the local oil
  crisis.

  The communist parties of such countries as France, Italy and others, in order
  to preserve their numbers, were obliged to repudiate a number of their
  aims. What do the "new models" of socialism mean to them?

  What is China searching for, steering its zigzagging course between the
  socialist and the most reactionary regimes of our time?

  Why have the questions of international class solidarity been moved to an
  inside page and then quietly buried? Why has the working class been gripped,
  as if by an epidemic, by an incapacity to pull itself out of the swamp of
  internal and altogether trivial affairs?

  Why has the philosophy of the twentieth century not given a direction capable
  of captivating the advanced thinkers and the youth? Why do all the newest
  theories destroy themselves, not lasting more than a few years; while only the
  philosophies of global, universal negation escape self destruction?

  The world looks in the mirror, wanting to see itself. But the reflection is
  vague and unsteady. Isn't that the spectre of communism? Isn't it there?

  Much can be seen in the mirror. If only you don't look in the dark or in the
  smokey glimmer of an oil lamp. If only you illuminate with the light of
  Marxism. If you look through the eyes of the proletariat. And if in the frame
  there really is a mirror, and not a map of the last century.

  It is time to look!

* The bourgeois and the proletarians

  The battle of the proletariat against the supremacy of the bourgeoisie was the
  object of the concerted attention of humanities finest minds. Their work was
  not in vain. It brought the victory of the proletarian revolution closer.

  Bourgeois and proletarian... The time which has passed since the Great October
  Revolution, both *permits and demands* the examination of the relations
  between the two most important classes, the two opposed ideologies, from the
  perspective of the victorious proletariat.

  Two problems arise with this plan.

  In the first place, in capitalist society, the bourgeoisie, in spite of the
  fact that it steals from the proletariat, fulfills definite social
  functions. In order to settle accounts with the bourgeoisie, the proletariat
  must take upon itself the entire burden of these functions. Sorting through
  this legacy, throwing out everything which merely provided a livelihood for
  the bourgeoisie, the activities specific to it, separating out those functions
  which are unavoidable even in a society without private property, and
  arranging for their fulfillment, is no easy task.

  Secondly, the proletariat does not emerge from the proletarian revolution,
  cleansed, renewed and ready for communism. No, it carries with it most of the
  bourgeois relations inculcated in it by capitalist society, it is thoroughly
  enmeshed in its worries about personal material well-being, it still thinks
  within the categories of the market both for goods and labour; it could not
  even exist otherwise. How can it find the strength to overcome this, and how
  can it be helped?

  For ages, capitalist society coped almost spontaneously with its problems. Of
  course, capitalism is not everlasting and can not cope with all the ever more
  acute problems which develop. The growth of the general crisis of capitalism
  (and it grows steadily) compels the bourgeoisie to become ever more organized,
  which directly contradicts its individualistic essence. The internal
  contradictions of an organized bourgeoisie appear, ever more clearly, in the
  rapid growth of corruption and all kinds of other crime, even in the most
  bourgeois environments. However, what is necessary for the preservation of
  capitalist production relations, i.e. the very basis of capitalist society, is
  determined by capitalism.

  The natural interest of the bourgeoisie play the decisive organizational role
  in capitalist society. They subordinate and coordinate the interests of all
  layers of society, among them the individualistic interests of workers. Only
  the interests of the organized, revolutionary proletariat are capable of
  opposing them. In other respects the bourgeoisie is fearless in taking upon
  itself the whole burden of organizing production and society; it fearlessly
  awards itself full dictatorial powers and thus realizes its dictatorship.

  Motivated by the striving for the accumulation of capital, that is the battle
  for maximum profit, in order to achieve its aims the bourgeoisie requires the
  steering of social relations along the course necessary to it, i.e. the path
  of the realization of a range of functions of a defined form which correct
  social relations. Thus society can be bound by a definite system of relations,
  but these must be obtained at the price of conscious effort.

  The most important of these functions are;

  - the organization of production
  - the development of production
  - the distribution of goods
  - regulation of relations between members of society
  - regulation of the development of social organizations and their relations
    with society


  The bourgeoisie also busies itself with other affairs; proving its
  competitiveness, struggle in the political sphere and so forth. These are the
  class tasks of the bourgeoisie itself; though they also relate to the
  functions, enumerated above, whose resolution is unavoidable even in a
  socialist society.

  Capitalist productive capacity has been historically stable because the
  bourgeoisie's success in satisfying the interests of practically all layers of
  society is dependent on the satisfaction of their own interests. We should not
  ascribe any great intellectual merit to the bourgeoisie on this account. They
  did not consciously shape this state of society, but rather this arose
  spontaneously by the will of objective law, which generalizes the various
  tendencies in the individual strategies of each bourgeois. The point is, that
  the final stage of spontaneous development of human society, in which
  collective interests appear as the replacement for individual interests (as
  distinct from the summation of the individual interests) can be organized in
  no other way than on the basis of revolutionary materialist theory, on the
  basis of the social realization of social tasks.

  How a classless society will manage these problems, overcoming all
  individualist tendencies, actively, in a spirit of unity, bringing to life its
  collective will, is relatively easier to clarify. But, arriving victorious
  from the battle with the bourgeoisie, the proletariat is still far from able
  to completely give up the qualities inherited from capitalist society. Before
  it still lies the protracted labour of self-education and the liberation of
  its own consciousness from the historically interwoven path of bourgeois
  individualism.

  This period in the life of the proletariat is extremely complicated and
  dangerous. Deeply rooted individualistic tendencies in the proletariat, even
  in the most proletarian environment, continue to erupt into activity, into the
  struggle for the acquisition of bourgeois (private) privileges; and on the
  foundation of masked forms of private property in the particular social
  situation, they construct definite personal dependencies and so forth. If any
  room for them exists in the fabric of society, such tendencies will inevitably
  create and shape a new bourgeoisie,

  The danger is intensified by the necessity for the proletarian state to appeal
  to the individualistic side of the consciousness of society's
  members. Capitalism produces skills and methods of work but does not foster
  the desire for work. Therefore, in order to involve the members of society in
  the production process, the proletarian state will have to utilize bourgeois
  stimuli; this means satisfying individual interests and what is more,
  retaining them, even encouraging their development.

  Implementing its dictatorship, the proletariat cannot avoid using an array of
  functions with bourgeois foundations; society is not ready for, nor capable
  of, their realization in another way. At the same time, the maintenance of
  *proletarian class* control is completely essential; or, in reverse, if
  control becomes the prerogative of whatever individual or group, not
  controlled in its turn by the *whole class*, the implementation of the
  dictatorship will become the business of this group, and will acquire a
  *private*, that is to say bourgeois, character, i.e. will signify the loss of
  the *proletarian dictatorship.*

  The proletariat must not be under any illusion about the juridical,
  constitutional consolidation of its right to class control of the most
  important social functions. *Genuine right*, at root, always obeys not a
  juridical but an objective law acting on society. It is not a coincidence that
  in bourgeois democratic countries, the authorities, elected in a society where
  the absolute majority is composed of workers, inevitably constitute the
  *dictatorship of the bourgeoisie*.

  The proletariat can not count upon the devotion and conscientiousness of its
  best representatives when placed in key positions; wherever the class is
  coping with emerging circumstances, to the individual representative this
  activity may appear to be out of control. And wherever control over the
  activities of the representatives is realized through their recallability, at
  will, by the class, such recallability must be guaranteed not only by *law*,
  but through the workings of natural social processes, otherwise it will become
  a fiction.

  In order to realize its historic aim, the development of a classless communist
  society, the proletariat requires not only the seizure of power but also the
  maintenance of its own dictatorship on all paths of development. And for this
  it is absolutely essential that the proletariat understand; *firstly*, the key
  points in the social system which it must bring under its class control;
  *secondly*, the method for realizing such control, and thus those objective
  laws of social development which guarantee the realization of this control;
  and *thirdly*, the proletariat must also master those social laws, the use of
  which would allow it, taking account of its own strength, to reestablish its
  control should it be weakened or lost. The power of the organized proletariat
  thus appears as a reliable guarantee in all its undertakings; but only if it
  does not lose its clear sense of purpose, its focus on the movement toward
  communism.

  The proletariat must be able to implement its dictatorship. This does not
  arise spontaneously, on the contrary, any spontaneity leads to degradation, to
  bourgeois breakdown. Only the highest organization of the spontaneous striving
  of the proletariat toward collective resolution of social problems, together
  with the knowledge and continuous development of revolutionary theory, can
  give the proletariat the right to the leading position in society.

  The proletariat must begin its mastery of the social possibilities for the
  consistent realization of its dictatorship with the study of the experience of
  its class enemy, the bourgeoisie.

  The bourgeoisie began with the organization of production. Only by seizing for
  itself the combination of labour with the means of production, did the
  bourgeoisie obtain the possibility of appropriating surplus product. The
  division of labour, the development of new technologies and ever greater
  specialization; all these guaranteed its victory over the previous mode of
  production.

  Thus, at the *first* stage, everything is decided by the organizing power of
  capital. Capitalist accumulation, serving as the aim of the capitalist,
  simultaneously compels him to search for means with which to raise the
  productivity of labour, and assists in solving the problem of the
  concentration of capital.

  At the *second* stage, the competition between the capitalists themselves
  appears decisive; this is the battle for the market. In this battle only those
  who get the highest productivity from labour, who own the largest share of
  production, who bring goods to market at the lowest prices, can be
  victorious. It is at this stage that the law of maximum profit fully manifests
  itself as the fundamental economic law of capitalism. Maximum profit; this is
  the capital essential for the opportune restructuring of production, for each
  restructuring in its turn brings superprofits which arise from a temporary
  monopoly of a perfected, more progressive technology.

  After which, the *third* stage is reached when further technological
  perfection requires protracted research, larger capital investment and is tied
  to an ever more protracted restructuring. The risk for the individual
  capitalist becomes immeasurably great; beginning such a profound
  restructuring, he has no guarantee that tomorrow one of his competitors may
  not produce a more perfect, revolutionary technology, requiring a less drawn
  out restructuring and a smaller investment. Such a guarantee is provided by
  the banding together of capitals, through growing monopolization, and so
  capitalism acquires its monopolistic character.

  And later, at the *fourth* stage, capitalism arrives at a dead end just before
  an era of vast technological change. These future changes demand such a
  general approach, abolishing the boundaries between branches of production,
  that capitalism is not destined to see such restructuring. Capitalism can't
  carry out such complicated research; it is impossible to keep it secret, but
  the loss of monopoly is equivalent to a useless expenditure of money. The most
  that capitalism is capable of is to entrust such research to the state or
  inter-state organization (these are the highest form of capitalist unity.) But
  the bourgeois state, being in a position to conduct research into complicated
  problems has absolutely no intention of doing so in the realm of increasing
  the effectiveness of production, for this could only result in the
  intensification of social contradictions. Herein, incidentally, lies the
  technological crisis, the technological side of the general crisis of
  capitalism.

  What can be extracted from the history of capitalism?

  Capitalism arises in society where there already exists a highly developed
  notion of property, where property already appears as the most important among
  the affirmations of the individual in society, and completes the development
  of the notion of private property in the consciousness of society, taking it
  to the limit.

  Correspondingly, in establishing itself, capitalism pursues only one aim,
  accumulation, the extension of private property. But private property
  interests the bourgeoisie in one completely defined form, the form of
  capital. For only private property in the means of production provides the
  possibility of the appropriation of newly created value in the form of surplus
  product, it provides accumulation.

  Continuous expansion accompanies the growth of capital, leading to the growth
  of competition, to the exacerbation of the struggle in the markets both for
  goods and for labour power. The struggle for monopoly ownership of highly
  productive production techniques speeds up the tempo of technical progress;
  while the exposure, the destruction of these temporary monopolies in the
  course of competition, makes the results of technical achievement accessible
  to the whole of society.

  But the possibilities for expansion are bounded. Their further development
  requires ever greater concentrations of capital. Capitalism becomes
  monopolistic, and this makes a mockery of the competitive struggle. With the
  result that, in defence of the production branch monopolies, the achievements
  of technical progress cannot be revealed to society. In conditions of monopoly
  capitalism, technical progress loses its decisive significance since the
  bourgeoisie obtains the possibility of supporting its profits by other
  means. Thus, the bourgeoisie ceases to play a progressive role in social
  development.

  It is not hard to see that the pace of development in capitalist society is
  dictated by the bourgeoisie. Nor is it hard to understand that the possibility
  of bourgeois control of development in its own interests rests upon the
  ownership of the means of production, on private property.

  But how, along what paths, does the bourgeoisie realize its possibilities?

  Abstract human knowledge develops in parallel with the development of the
  creative skill of humanity. From time to time it is enriched by practice with
  completely new discoveries. But only the bourgeoisie recognizes, organizes and
  increases the army of the intelligentsia, placing it in the service of
  capital. The bourgeoisie compels the intelligentsia to worry about
  organization and the improvement of production, drawing it in to applied
  scientific research. This factor serves as the source of many of the
  achievements of capitalism, therefore we recognize it as a root cause,
  absolutely essential in its essence.

  The first steps of capitalism are firmly tied to the division of
  labour. Speaking of which, merely noting the division of the production
  process into individual operations, and that new methods permit the use of
  less qualified labour power, and further that the reduction of the time
  required for the acquisition of essential skills itself provides a decisive
  advantage, would mean missing the most important point. The point is that the
  combination of individual operations into a single production process was
  itself divided from the labour process; in this way it became possible to
  divide these functions among individual categories of workers, to break the
  link between them and to oppose the organizers of production to the immediate
  producers. The result was that to the one fell the lot of labour, while,
  simultaneously, the others were liberated from labour in order to occupy
  themselves with improving productivity. Plainly, the essence lies in this
  *division*, although it was not historically the first division of a similar
  nature. Its particular character was imparted to it by the achievements of
  humanity at the level of development of the productive forces of the time.

  The cooperation among craftsmen and their combination into guilds stimulated
  the intensification of labour, but did not assist in the dissemination of
  advanced methods of work even within the boundaries of the guild. On the
  contrary, each member of the guild had an interest in preserving his
  secrets. This held the development of production back; further movement
  demanded new stimuli, and these arose with the division of labour.

  The separation of the organizers of production, singling them out as a
  particular category of workers, accompanied and strengthened the formation of
  the systems for the distribution of goods, stimulated their activities in the
  direction of raising the productivity of the labour of the immediate
  producers.

  The guild master, himself formerly an immediate producer, became the
  *production* master and no longer took part in labour; but he remained
  interested in it since, the more completely the producers submitted to his
  command, the more productive the methods of work, the greater the *value* that
  would be expressed by their labour united in the final product.

  Thus, the master also remained interested in guarding his organizational
  knowledge, his production secrets and the growth of a widespread circle of
  producers subordinated to him. The breaking of such a monopoly threatened to
  reduce the value of the resulting product. But, firstly, he had to reveal his
  knowledge to the producers. And secondly, the master was to find himself in a
  completely different situation.

  The master-boss, master-capitalist, owning the means of production, openly
  strove to sell his product at the highest price; at a price including not just
  the essential labour added by the producers, but also a superprofit arising
  from his monopoly of organizational and technical knowledge.

  The hired master, the master organizing production belonging to another owner,
  also strove to maximize the benefit obtained from his monopoly of
  knowledge. On the other hand, the owner strove to maximize his share of the
  profits and in relations with the hired master was clearly guided by
  this. Correspondingly, for the hired master, his share of the goods was
  defined depending on the extent of the superprofits received by the owner; the
  capitalist stimulated the interest of the master only in the increase of
  superprofits which were appropriated by the capitalist.

  The paths of the master-capitalist and the hired master were sharply
  divergent. The capitalist no longer needed to possess a monopoly of knowledge
  himself, he bought this knowledge, paying for it with a part of the
  superprofits to which it gave rise. By appropriating the surplus labour and a
  share of the superprofit the capitalist guaranteed his existence in the world
  of competitive struggle.

  The hired master was obliged to sell his knowledge, capabilities and creative
  potential under the conditions of competitive struggle, where the measures and
  criteria by no means served the master himself, but always the superprofits of
  the capitalist.

  The capitalist was ready to pay for any knowledge, invention, discovery,
  effective method of raw materials preparation, marketing, methods of
  organization or production technology, any *ideal goods*, so long as they
  brought him *superprofits*. All this assisted the formation of a particular
  layer of society, the intelligentsia, whose specific function became the
  continuous development of the organizational knowledge of the capitalists.

  The increase in the productivity of labour was and remains the fundamental
  method for the creation of superprofits. It would be a mistake to suppose that
  increasing productivity of labour increases the immediate profit of the
  capitalist, permitting him to appropriate a larger share of the surplus
  product. Indeed, such redistribution is only possible because the resulting
  product, realized at its value, exceeds the quantity of labour actually
  materialized in it; but this arises because the given capitalist has a
  definite advantage in methods of work, i.e. possesses a definite monopoly of
  these methods. The breaking of this monopoly leads to the lowering of the
  value of the resulting product and the loss of the capitalist of the
  *superprofits*, although he clearly still makes a profit.

  This is important to note, in order to understand that the labour of the
  intelligentsia (ideal, creative labour) neither creates value nor increases
  it. All value is created solely by the labour of the workers. However, clearly
  the intelligentsia provides an increase of the effectiveness of production in
  a well-defined sense, that of the "in natura" increase of the resulting
  product. In the bourgeois this fact gives rise not to joy, but worry, for it
  threatens to produce a crisis of overproduction. But the bourgeois does not
  want to drop out of the race for maximum profit, or the linked pursuit of
  superprofits, and, consequently, can not oppose this process.

  Thus, separately stimulating the productivity of labour through its
  intensification, (payment for labour power) and heightening the productivity
  of labour through improved organization, (payment for the creative labour of
  the intelligentsia) the capitalist wages the struggle for maximum profits,
  which are composed of surplus value and superprofits arising from the activity
  of the intelligentsia.

  The bourgeoisie creates nothing with its own hands, it achieves its aims by
  commanding the activities of others. It is the labour of the proletariat that
  creates capital for the bourgeoisie. The organizers of production concern
  themselves with raising the share of labour appropriated by the bourgeoisie to
  the highest level. The creative intelligentsia produces inventions in order
  that the bourgeoisie can extract its superprofits. And all this because the
  bourgeoisie undividedly holds in its hands one social obligation, the
  distribution of labour and material goods.

  No, it is not omnipotent in this question, its possibilities are limited by
  the objective laws of capitalist society. But the capitalist clearly knows
  these laws and does not miss even a single one of the opportunities which they
  afford him.

  Through competitive haggling in the market for labour power, he obtains labour
  power, but only such labour power, according to qualification, age, and other
  measures, from which he is able to extract, under the concrete conditions, the
  greatest quantity of surplus labour.

  The capitalist hires production organizers only, to the extent necessary, in
  order that they will worry about raising the productivity of labour and thus
  maximize his superprofits. He also hires lawyers, specialist in commercial
  operations and other employees to worry about his superprofits, but these are
  already outside the production sphere.

  The capitalist finances scientific research and technical creativity, but only
  as an advance against the superprofits which monopoly ownership of new
  achievements, new knowledge, will bring.

  So the capitalist accomplishes the distribution with a quantitative measure of
  goods, wages.

  In choosing the direction of development of production, his orientation to the
  output of definite goods, (and the capitalist always does this himself,)
  relying on the analysis of market conditions and production forecasts done by
  hired specialists, he participates in the production of a definite qualitative
  composition by society. In so far as he grabs a corner of the existing market,
  he necessarily must take into account the existence of a social demand and try
  to satisfy that demand.

  And when, in the end, the capitalist has managed the distribution of goods, it
  turns out that the distribution of labour has also already been decided. It
  decided how many and which specialists he needed, which workstations the
  workers manned and what the intelligentsia occupied themselves with. The
  capitalist in no way intends to separate these questions; those who bring in
  the profits receive the goods. As for the rest, the capitalist is not
  troubled; because each, struggling to increase the quantity of goods for
  himself, provides an increase in the profits *for him*, there is a
  *convergence of interests*.

  Of course, there are class contradictions in the world; when the proletariat
  becomes more organized for struggle, the capitalist can not decide his
  problems in a one-sided manner, without the support of other forces. In order
  to manage society in the interests of private property, the bourgeoisie simply
  must direct social movement into those channels where it can place its dams
  and dikes. This channel is the channel of private property, and its banks are
  whole sum of the social relations of the capitalist world, and in the first
  place, the entire power of its organizations, supporting and shaping these
  relations. The grandest of these organizations is the bourgeois state with its
  numerous means of control over society.

  State power in the majority of capitalist countries is formed from very
  *democratic beginnings*. This does not prevent it however, from remaining the
  dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Universal suffrage hardly frightens the
  bourgeoisie, even in conditions where the industrial proletariat makes up a
  large part of the population. Why are a handful of capitalists completely
  unconcerned about the outbreak of a struggle for power?

  Because, in the struggle for power, strength prevails, not numbers. And the
  formula for strength in society has a simple form; numbers plus
  organization. Uniting in political parties, buying the intellectually
  developed part of humanity practically whole, disposing of the organizing
  power of the mass media, financing various societies and single-minded
  campaigns, the bourgeoisie does not simply shape social opinion in its
  support, it suppresses, muffles and drowns in the general noise the voices of
  the opponents of its ideology. The organizing capabilities of wealth, money
  and property, these are what assist the bourgeoisie, not just in the
  reproduction of capital but in the reworking of society.

  Through natural stinginess, the bourgeoisie misses, and in the future will
  continue to miss, those moments when the organization of the proletariat and
  general left forces reaches levels dangerous to it, as was the case, for
  example, in Chile in 1970. But then all is still not lost for them. If under
  normal "democratic" conditions, the bourgeoisie prefers to deal with the
  proletariat, spending the necessary minimum part of its profits on
  organization, the threat of giving up private property in general compels it
  to give up more. Then, neither regretting nor stinting, the bourgeoisie will
  lay out money on the creation of a fascist regime. Fascism is the other side
  of bourgeois democracy. It is also a dictatorship, but in an unadorned
  form. Under "democratic" conditions the bourgeoisie prefers to conduct the
  struggle with the proletariat by democratic means; it obstructs the
  organization of the proletariat with broad ideological pressure, bringing
  chaos into the workers own single-minded trend and financing bourgeois
  organizations sufficiently for oppositional activities. With fascism, such
  organizational advantages secure for the bourgeoisie the forcible destruction
  of workers organizations and the direct liquidation of proletarian
  organizational centres through arrests and executions. For the bourgeoisie
  this is a further loss, and brings complications in the economy, but they know
  that these are hard times. With the damage, destruction, the loss of its best
  cadre and existing connections, the workers organizations leave the system and
  withdraw from the political arena. And when fascism becomes unnecessary, they
  can write it off on the quiet, and having reestablished their organizational
  advantage over the uncoordinated proletarian forces within the framework of a
  most peculiar bourgeois "democracy," they curse, for a long while, about the
  vileness of the fascist terror, portraying it a as an isolated black spot on
  the otherwise pure democratic history of capitalist society.

  This is how the bourgeoisie settles its organizational problems. By comparison
  with this the regulation of personal relations is a trifling matter. Here just
  one condition is necessary, namely, that bourgeois state asserts the
  inviolability of private property, with all its legislation, courts and
  weapons. Of course, in every concrete case each concrete capitalist also tries
  to grab that which the law has not offered. Each bourgeois gets, with
  difficulty, the idea that justice is good and that it is for the
  powerful. And, of course, all of this gives rise to a vast system of
  corruption and the making of deals among the powerful bourgeois against the
  whole of society. But these are the particulars of capitalist existence.

  So, the private property interest of the bourgeoisie serve in capitalist
  society as the most important organizational basis. The process of realization
  of these interests, the sum of the activities undertaken by the bourgeoisie
  for their satisfaction, simultaneously appears both as the implementation of a
  range of social functions, without which the cooperative activity of the
  members of society would lack completeness, and as the whole, essential for
  the existence of society.

  Are all similar functions fulfilled by the bourgeoisie itself? Definitely
  not. Really, wherever it turns out to be possible, the bourgeoisie draws in
  the intelligentsia. All leading posts in capitalist society are handed out to
  the intelligentsia. State functionaries right up to the very highest come from
  the intelligentsia. Technical and commercial leaders at all ranks come from
  the intelligentsia. Also, to the intelligentsia falls all ideological
  work. The creative potential of the intelligentsia is exploited by the
  capitalist world with all its might.

  This situation of the intelligentsia, together with the developing
  depersonalization of capital, in the form of joint stock companies and other
  forms of capitalist cooperation, permit many bourgeois ideologues to speak
  about the retreat of capitalism from key positions, about the passing of power
  to the hands of the intelligentsia and its formulation, cooperatively,
  according to its laws of the commercial-technical systems, of progressive
  economic policy, supposedly independent of the capitalists, not answerable to
  them. This is a lie, because never have the capitalists given up *control over
  the distribution of goods* to anyone, because in granting to the
  intelligentsia the right *to lead*, the bourgeoisie retains for itself the
  right to *decide the direction*, because the capitalists are ready to pay for
  the activities of any administrator, politician or engineer, the activity of
  any system, just so long as they meticulously fulfill their principal
  obligation to the capitalists, the provision of maximum profit for them.

  However important the position of the intelligentsia in bourgeois society
  might appear to be, the bourgeoise, while permitting it to do as it pleases,
  *does not allow it to go beyond the bounds of what is comfortable for the
  bourgeoisie*.

  And for all that, the intelligentsia plays its highly essential role in
  bourgeois society. The individualistic worldview, the firm graft onto
  bourgeois society, the accessibility to the intelligentsia of all posts, the
  appearance of being the source of social structure, in combination with the
  practical experience of the intelligentsia in resolving major and minor
  problems on the basis of calculation and reasoned agreement, gives rise to the
  specific convictions of the intelligentsia, the belief in the possibility of
  stabilizing society and strengthening its rational foundation. At the heart of
  every intellectual is his completed model for restructuring society, which
  consists of the removal of such obstacles as he has experienced in his
  personal relations with society, and the illogicality of whose existence
  appears self-evident to him. Remaining outside the heat of class conflict, and
  untroubled by the analysis of class forces and class interests, the
  intelligentsia proves itself not to be in a position to (nor, indeed, does it
  manifest any powerful striving to) understand that everything taken by him as
  an obstacle is at heart an expression of the real and unavoidable class
  contradiction, that these "obstacles" give him knowledge of the iron grip of
  the capitalist, affirming his interests.

  Such a spiritual atmosphere gives rise in the midst of the intelligentsia to a
  mass of theories of the "rational," but in fact wholely idealistic and thus
  groundless, organization of society. All these theories play into the hands of
  the bourgeoisie, for they distract the thinking part of humanity from
  participation in class struggle, they mask the genuine source of social
  contradiction. But even more important, the apparent attainability of Utopian
  social structures shapes in the intelligentsia a definite caste
  viewpoint. This leads them to think of themselves as a class capable of taking
  on the whole responsibility for the fate of society. This mass delusion,
  sprouting in the fertile soil of hypertrophied self-love, characteristic of
  the intelligentsia, conceals from it its own secondary, service role in
  society. The bourgeoisie keenly supports these maniacal prejudices, for the
  intelligentsia, in its confusion, reliably serves the bourgeoisie; when it
  sees more clearly, becoming conscious of the obligatory character of its
  service, it is capable of making the revolutionary choice and serving the
  proletariat.

  The fact that in capitalist society, the very existence of the intelligentsia
  is called forth by the demands of the bourgeoisie and is possible only under
  its supervision, not unnaturally, only assists the strengthening of the caste
  mentality. These same activities of capital, taken by the intelligentsia as
  annoying obstacles, provide a definite equilibrium in capitalist society, its
  wholeness and coordination; they prevent the intelligentsia from testing the
  groundlessness of its theories and so support the intelligentsia's belief that
  peace and order exist exclusively thanks to its efforts.

  Two consequence of this state of affairs directly touch the interests of the
  proletariat. *Firstly*, the social caste outlook of the intelligentsia closes
  it in on itself and cuts it off from the proletariat, and this results in
  serious damage to the development of the proletariat's world-encompassing
  ideology and weakens the organizational work without which the proletariat can
  neither prepare for nor enter into the decisive class battle. *Secondly*,
  after the victory of the proletariat, however much it may need the creative
  potential of the intelligentsia, it cannot trust it; striving to realize in
  practice its numerous personal theories, unavoidably leads the intelligentsia
  to a single non-contradictory combination of them, to the resurrection of
  capitalist relations.

  In order not only to win power, but not to lose it anew, in order to be able
  to bring order after victory, the proletariat is obliged to know all these
  mysteries of capitalist society and all the social forces existing in
  it. Before it lies the task of taking them as an inheritance, transforming
  them and directing them to the construction of the new society.

* The Proletariat as the master
  While the proletariat is conducting its struggle in capitalist society, while
  it remains a class, opposing with ever greater strength the hated bourgeois
  order, it is sufficient to build solidarity around one idea, the idea of
  socialist revolution. But on completion of the proletarian revolution, having
  negated, destroyed bourgeois society and the state, the proletariat is
  confronted by the necessity of building a new society, discovering,
  maintaining and creating new functional links, increasing society's wholeness
  and completeness. This is the law of negation, implacable negation; society,
  from which those functions fulfilled by the bourgeoisie have been withdrawn,
  demands their replacement or renewal; and not every replacement is necessarily
  equally suitable. In the opposite case, all the holes will be filled
  spontaneously, in the form and likeness of those rejected earlier. And if the
  proletariat is not ready to renew and restructure the whole system of social
  relations, inevitably a new bourgeoisie will arise, appropriating the
  functions and privileges of the old bourgeoisie.

  In previous revolutionary epochs, a succession of functions arose
  spontaneously; the proletariat can not hope for this to happen. In previous
  crises in history, each slave owner, feudal or bourgeois, tied his own little
  knots in the net of social relations. But the socialist revolution
  qualitatively distinguishes itself in that a new subject, the class, enters
  the arena of struggle, and it wins only because it possesses the organizing
  power of a single subject and is able to rule only thanks to the strength of
  its own unity.

  Acting spontaneously, the workers themselves are unable to rise higher than
  respectable trade-unionism, an entirely bourgeois level. Only a qualitatively
  different form of organization of class consciousness, concretizing the
  individual interests and raising them to the level of collective class
  interests, permits the proletariat to decide social problems and provides the
  proletariat with a decisive advantage in the struggle with the bourgeoisie and
  bourgeois ideology; as much after the proletarian revolution as before
  it. Also, the difficulties arising for the proletariat bear their own
  qualitative distinctions.

  Firstly, the proletariat needs a good, reliable theory. While the individual,
  who is himself a unity, may act successfully thanks to personal knowledge or
  talent, flair or luck, the proletariat can supply unity of purpose and mutual
  agreement in its activities only through the coordination of all concrete
  tasks within the framework of an integral, systematic world view.

  Secondly, the mistakes and delusions of individuals, the inaccuracy of their
  estimates and the groundlessness of their decisions have no influence on the
  development of society as a whole; they happen and are set aside in the
  fulfillment of the functions of single individuals, they occupy another
  space. But blanks in the class consciousness of the proletariat, weaknesses in
  its knowledge, its mistakes, signify nothing other than retreat before the
  bourgeoisie; the bourgeoisie swiftly returns "to the rescue," wherever the
  proletariat does not cope with the responsibilities of a leader.

  Thirdly, a society resting on the interests of individuals, exerts no effort
  to compensate for individual losses which occur spontaneously through the
  action of those same interests. Loss or retreat by the proletariat means a
  reversion to the revolutionary road, they demand the repetition of the
  revolutionary labour, the repetition of the battle with the bourgeoisie.

  Therefore, the proletariat requires a well-elaborated theory, methods
  permitting the timely evaluation of changes in circumstances and resulting in
  correct decisions, and the skill to conduct research, enriching its knowledge
  at the smallest cost. This is its weapon and must always be battle-ready.

  Two problems must be solved by the proletariat in undertaking the construction
  of a new society;

  1. increasing the well-being of society,
  2. developing its consciousness.

  Success in the second problem depends, almost entirely, on the resolution of
  the first. As for the the first question, it is essential for the proletariat
  to obtain a decisive verdict; it must not simply surpass the level of the
  leading capitalist countries; not only outstrip them, but outstrip them
  utterly, smashing through the boundary which is unattainable for them.

  Proletarian society is capable of overcoming those obstacles before which
  capitalism grinds to a halt, having reached its highest level of
  development. But this will not happen of its own accord. Such are the
  interests of the victorious proletariat, but the path to their satisfaction
  remains to be discovered. And here the proletariat can't make do without the
  experience of the previous generation, here it must learn from the
  bourgeoisie.

  The first and altogether general conclusion flowing from past experience is
  that society inevitably moves in the direction of the spontaneous striving of
  its members. But this is still not the conclusion, only half of it. The vital
  missing piece is the conditions of existence. It was not for nothing that
  bourgeoisie battled for the general recognition of private property in the
  means of production; this was both the condition for the development of
  capitalism and the channel into which the elements were directed. Under the
  conditions of socialism the means of production appear as social property. But
  clarity is essential here. The 'society' controlling the means of production
  may only be a part of society; and then its property becomes private
  property. Capitalism itself does not avoid the social form of property; take
  for example the joint-stock company. The character of socialism entirely
  depends on the relations of the societies with ownership of the means of
  production to society as a whole. To the extent that aim of the proletariat is
  proletarian socialism, there is only one acceptable form: all-proletarian
  class property. In detail, this means that, having won the means of production
  in revolutionary struggle, the proletariat must neither give them up nor share
  the rights and privileges of the proprietor.

  How to keep these rights and how to manage them? This, the proletariat must
  learn directly from the bourgeoisie.

  The pursuit of maximum profit, dictated to the capitalists by the conditions
  of competitive struggle, compels them to conduct uninterrupted research into
  raising the productivity of labour. The consequences of this are an increase
  in production output and capitalist superprofits. The progressive social
  content of this process is revealed when the exposure of monopoly to
  competition results in the falling price of production output.

  The proletariat and indeed the whole of society need higher productivity of
  labour. So how do things stand under different conditions.

  In abolishing capitalism, the proletariat abolishes capitalist competition.

  The extraction of maximum profit cannot be the aim of the proletariat;
  whatever the sum of the profits might be, it could only return to whence it
  came, to the proletariat.

  The proletariat has even less interest in superprofits.

  It is the maximal effectiveness of production which is the fundamental
  interest of the proletariat. In the first place, the well-being of the
  proletariat depends directly on this, for the proletariat can get no goods
  that it did not produce itself. In the second place, increasing effectiveness
  of production leads to a reduction of the outlay of labour, the outlay of
  time, required for the production essential to society. These savings are then
  dedicated to the cultural and creative development of the proletariat, for the
  growth of its consciousness.

  Thus, in the pursuit of maximal effectiveness of production, the proletariat
  is interested in the continuous raising of the productivity of labour, leading
  to an increase in the "in natura" expression of production. The only interest
  of the proletariat in superprofits lies in the fastest exposure of all
  monopolies and the fullest dissemination of advanced production methods. But
  here the proletariat distinguishes itself from the capitalist really, only by
  scale; the capitalist is interested in the fullest and fastest dissemination
  of new methods within the segment of production belonging to him, so too is
  the proletariat.

  The interests of the proletariat in the whole, correspond to the interests of
  the individual capitalist in capitalist society. In essence these interests
  present the elevated humanistic development of bourgeois ones. The place of
  abstract maximal profit is taken by the completely concrete maximal
  effectiveness of production, which is directly rather than indirectly linked
  to the increase of production, the maximization of goods expressed "in
  natura." This happens because the basis of the fundamental interests of the
  proletariat, as owner, lies not in the inhuman demand for the affirmation of
  private property in competitive struggle, but in the human demand of the
  proletariat as the class of consumers. Labour and production return to their
  primordial destiny, serving as the source of satisfaction of immediate human
  need, not distorted by the oppressive complex of social injustice with its
  demand for a struggle against the rest of society for existence.

  The existence of a definite analogy between the interests of the proletariat
  and the individual capitalist permits us to draw one between the realization
  of these interests. The capitalist secures his interests by stimulating the
  activities of the workers, the production organizers, the technologists,
  inventors and experts in areas of importance to him. He does not utilize a
  system of stimuli which has been consolidated once and for all. On the
  contrary, he utilizes the natural striving of people for a more complete
  satisfaction of demands, oriented to maximum effect in the direction which is
  fundamental to him, the receipt of profits.

  The capitalist does not distribute all goods himself. But, in entrusting to
  some the distribution of goods to the rest, the capitalist personally decides
  the reward for his lieutenants. In this role he selects people who are more
  zealous and capable in defending his interests; and their share of the goods
  depends directly on their fulfillment of his demands. The capitalist
  recognizes no other criterion than his own interests, whose ultimate
  expression is maximum profit.

  The fundamental decisions of direction such as the orientation to the output
  of products of a particular type and the choice of the direction of
  development and capital investment, the capitalist makes himself. These
  decisions coalesce into a single unity, his personal subjective economic
  policy. No objective factors can act on these policies other than through the
  consciousness of the capitalist, through refraction in his consciousness they
  become the conditions of decisions taken.

  Faced with alternatives, where the evaluation of variations on increasing the
  ultimate effect is difficult, the capitalist makes his own subjective
  choices. This subjectivity is not arbitrary, it lies in the rut of general
  economic policy. From each of his workers, encouraging their successes and
  punishing their failures, the capitalist demands following such a policy; that
  is, for each, according to ability, to subjectively decide the problems at his
  level.

  Who among these must the proletariat study?

  All of them!

  While defining the direction of production according to its subjective class
  demands, subordinating it to its own criterion, maximal effectiveness, in all
  other respects, the proletariat must seize the rational methods already
  discovered by the capitalists.

  And here there arises an important difficulty, the resolution of which cannot
  be suggested by any capitalist experience.

  The interests of the capitalist are affirmed by the capitalist himself. The
  wholeness of the capitalist as a person is defined, unitarily, as the
  unidirectionality of his economic policy.

  The interests of the proletariat are class interests. The subject expressing
  them is the whole class. For the interests of any individual representatives
  or groups distinguish themselves from the interests of the class; since only
  for the entire proletariat does the satisfaction of its demands directly
  depend on the effectiveness of production; only the whole producing class
  cannot provide itself with anything that it did not produce.

  Implementing an integral economic policy, corresponding to the interests of
  the class is not achievable by the proletariat as a mass of workers. It is
  achievable only by the organized class, by the proletariat, in the overcoming
  of its individualistic tendencies, in becoming conscious of its collective
  aims. And this is still not an answer, not a form for the realization of the
  ownership right of the proletariat.

  The class interests of the proletariat find a concrete form, represented in
  the consciousness of the individual in the form of clear ideas, slogans, ideas
  accessible to the masses and capable of raising them to organized
  activity. And although the dissemination and assimilation of ideas demands
  time and effort, the proletariat will, all the more, be able to be its own
  leader.

  Expressing the interests of the proletariat in the most precise, concentrated
  system of ideas, the leader embodies and materializes them in the mass
  activities of the proletariat. The fact that, accordingly, the complex
  leadership structure, itself clearly composed of individuals, participates in
  the organization of mass activities changes nothing; this system is supported
  and disciplined by the understanding that the masses need such concrete ideas,
  by the response of the masses and their readiness to follow the ideas of the
  leader. Such a system not only disseminates and supports ideas, but is
  capable, in a more active form, of negating and refuting ideas which cut
  against the mood of the masses and of liberating itself from leaders under the
  sway of such groundless ideas. In action this system form the class
  consciousness of the proletariat into a unified subject; participation in the
  mass movement brings, to each individual, consciousness of revolutionary
  change and forms the base for the further development of class consciousness.

  Before the proletarian socialist state, at the start, lie other tasks. Taking
  away from capitalism the vast management system, taking society, in which
  there not only remain non proletarian elements but also within the proletariat
  itself powerful, previously inculcated, individualistic, bourgeois strivings,
  the socialist state must seize for itself the regulation of all the social
  relations linked with them. It must unite within it definite characteristics
  of the bourgeois state and capitalist system of management. If the mass
  movement leans on the best, most advanced, revolutionary qualities of the
  proletariat, then the state unavoidably is oriented to the worst, most
  backward, yet still not eliminated, characteristics of the proletariat and all
  of society, and must create systems for their regulation. In its inner
  essence, in its relations with its citizens, the state always remains
  bourgeois, not rising beyond the principles of bourgeois justice. But this
  does not apply to its external relations, to its relations with people who are
  not citizens; here the proletarian state comes acts only as the fully
  empowered proletariat, only as the representative of its class interests.

  These are the social foundations of society which the proletariat must learn
  before using the capitalist science of management.

  The plenipotentiary boss of all the conquered means of production is the
  proletariat as a unitary whole.

  The interests of the proletariat are personified in the leaders of the
  proletariat. That is, it falls to the leaders to concretize the aims and to
  construct the policies in their concrete and concerted form. All the same, the
  decisive word on these questions remains with the class, for only through the
  support of the masses can the leaders test their political ideas.

  The interests of the proletariat are fulfilled by the socialist state. The
  state acts like a system hired by the workers, (formed in the same way as a
  capitalist would, for the realization of the will of the owner and finding
  itself under his subjective control) dependent on the will of its master, the
  proletariat as a whole, in all its sections.

  The socialist state as an administrative organ does not deal with the
  proletariat as a class. It administers society as an aggregate of individuals;
  workers, peasants and intelligentsia. It takes care of both single individuals
  and social strata; it must protect against and cut short their activities only
  to the extent that this corresponds with the interests of the proletariat; and
  in this it must also be continuously supervised.

  The state apparatus must be made up of suitable staff, and here the
  utilization of capitalist science begins in full measure. The highest posts
  need trustworthy people whose devotion to the interests of the proletariat is
  beyond doubt, having been subjected to stringent verification. From them the
  proletariat demands a profound understanding of its interests at the current
  stage and the ability to realize these interests in concrete activities, in
  well chosen executors and in current policy. But all-proletarian control and
  evaluation must accompany them in every activity.

  A particularly important sphere of activity for the socialist state is the
  economy. In replacing the capitalist striving for maximal profits with the
  socialist demand for maximum production effectiveness the socialist state must
  subordinate the entire management system to this demand.

  In the first place, this applies to the management apparatus. The apparatus of
  production organizers must be rewarded in direct dependence on the
  organizational investment in heightening the productivity of labour and must
  be very highly rewarded.

  Why is this so? Why can not (or must not) the victorious proletariat dictate
  to the technical intelligentsia its own, different conditions? Why can the
  leading class not exploit the creative capabilities of the specialists in the
  same merciless way that the capitalist exploits the workers?

  Because this is not advantageous to the proletariat, it contradicts its
  interests.

  The display of talent and creative ability possess an individual
  character. The struggle for social and self recognition serves as the stimulus
  for individual manifestations of ability. As long as commodity-money relations
  continue to exist in society, recognition in the distribution of goods will
  remain one of the elements of recognition in general.

  But it is precisely upon creative activities that the perfection of production
  depends, the growth of its effectiveness; whether it be the activities of the
  production organizers or the creative initiative of the masses
  themselves. Growth in production of goods without an additional expenditure of
  labour - this is also the economic aim of the proletariat; it is quite ready
  to devote a portion of this growth to movement in this direction.

  And if we glance back at the capitalist and learn from him, it may be seen
  that he loses nothing through the highly paid specialist but rather increases
  his profits. Besides which, he encourage a competitive struggle for
  recognition among them, leading to a full disclosure of their abilities,
  permitting him to select the best among them. In refusing to adopt such an
  approach, the proletariat can only harm itself.

  The individual evaluation of each specialist must be based on the extent to
  which his activities are useful to the proletariat and this must be an
  assessment in the grand scheme, from the heights of class interests. As far as
  the share of any remaining capitalist is concerned, it must be said that if
  the proletariat does not offer its specialists the opportunity of obtaining
  more benefits that in the service of any capitalist, then it is a bad
  boss. Work for socialist society must attract, for their own benefit, the most
  prominent specialist of the capitalist world. The proletariat will only become
  richer through the exploitation of their abilities, since that which is
  advantageous to the capitalist is many times more advantageous in the
  socialist economy which is not limited by the competitive monopolies.

  But how should the leading class relate to its members? Can it, in general,
  have any concept of this question, if the class as a whole is composed of
  these very same workers?

  This question exists and is quite well founded. The proletariat, organized as
  a class, is not identical with aggregate of the workers of which it is
  composed. The distinction has already arisen through the existence of its own
  organization. This organization is based on a community of interests; but this
  is not a community of all the interests, some of them continue to be in
  contradiction with the interests of the whole class.

  The class is interested in the increase of goods for all, the individual
  worker also for himself. But he can obtain them either together with the class
  or, in the bourgeois manner, by striving to appropriate the labour of his
  comrades in the class. Until such time as this contradiction is no longer
  lodged in the consciousness of the worker, a definite contradiction between
  the proletariat and each proletarian, between the class and the individual
  will continue to be maintained.

  And this means that, until that time, the organized class must defend its
  interests against spontaneous outcroppings of petty-property, bourgeois
  interests. This struggle is conducted on two fronts. On the one hand, the
  struggle as a whole is for such a revolutionary change in the consciousness of
  everyone that the bourgeois individualistic interests wither and disappear. On
  the other hand, while they continue to exist, the proletariat is obliged to
  make good use of them, turning them to the benefit of society.

  The principal economic task of the proletariat is the continuous growth in the
  goods produced for a given investment of labour. And the execution of this
  task is determined not by the labour of the workers, but rather by the extent
  to which this labour is effectively utilized, the extent of development of the
  whole system of production and the extent to which those whom the proletariat
  have hired to organize production fulfill their obligations. Therefore, if a
  known investment of labour in social production, without the fulfillment of
  which goods in general cannot be reproduced, is the duty of the workers, then
  their fundamental interest in the increase of such goods must be secured
  through the demand for creative output from the production organizers and such
  control of their activities as will permits the selection of the most capable;
  that is through continuous maintenance of a class stand. However, in carrying
  out this task, the proletariat confronts the necessity of applying these
  demands to itself; because labour, to an even greater extent, does not yet
  universally recognize this duty and because such recognition hinders the
  individualistic interests.

  As regards these same interests, which rule in capitalist society, the task
  facing the proletariat consists in organizing them and directing them into the
  required channels; that is to say, as the boss, using these interests,
  stimulating the workers' activity for the benefit of the boss - the whole
  working class. Also in this way, in relations with the workers, policy is
  dictated by a single consideration, the interests of the proletariat as a
  class, as an integral whole.

  The fundamental law, which defines the existence of the proletarian socialist
  state, and which the victorious proletariat must be guided by and which the
  state system must serve, may be formulated as follows;

  #+begin_quote
  "The distribution of labour and manufactured goods in the interests of society
  as a whole, thus stimulating the growth of social well-being and social
  consciousness"
  #+end_quote

  The growth of social well-being serves as the material basis for the
  development of consciousness; increasing effectiveness of production leads to
  the reduction of the essential expenditure of labour, to the liberation of
  time for cultural development. But the principle questions for the development
  of communist consciousness remain unresolved by this.

  The opportunities for the socialist state in the business of developing
  consciousness are extremely limited. In essence, the task of the state is not
  itself to change the consciousness of the masses, but to strengthen the
  progressive changes in their consciousness which have already sprung up, in
  state form, in corresponding changes in all the management systems of society.

  However, in relations with non-proletarian strata of society, the state serves
  as the executor of the class will of the proletariat, playing a very active
  role. The very existence of such strata is permitted to just that extent which
  corresponds to the interests of the proletariat. The interests and demands of
  the non-proletarian strata are taken into consideration only to the extent
  that they correspond to the most effective utilization of these sections of
  society for the benefit of the proletariat. Whatever particular democratic
  opportunities for the expression of personal opinion, for the exposition of
  such ideas as were not demanded of them, is allowed to the non-proletarian
  sections of society by the proletariat, it is with a single aim; to utilize
  these interests, to stimulate them, compelling the highest level of
  performance both in labour and in talent of these sections of society for the
  benefit of the proletariat. In proportion to development, changes in the
  interests of the proletariat will inevitably give rise to changes in the
  relations with other classes and social groups regarding their demands and
  their livelihood. Correspondingly, the character of the political freedoms
  permitted by the state for such strata will change. Therefore, there cannot be
  any question of political guarantees for these strata, with the exception of
  temporary agreements, into which the proletariat enters, considering the
  concrete form of its interests, corresponding to the current stage of history.

  Correspondingly, accompanying such a dictatorial policy in relations with the
  non-proletarian strata, the proletarian state decides the most important
  question for the restructuring of their consciousness, demonstrating with all
  the means at its disposal that their only real guarantee is to irrevocably
  adopt the proletarian class positions. Interelations with the ruling class
  have a completely different basis. Remaining, in relation to the proletariat,
  one of the most backward social institutions, the state can not be so
  conservative that it cannot change following the development of the interests
  of the proletariat.

  In the political sphere this signifies the continuous broadening of democracy
  for the proletariat. State control, state regulation of various aspects of
  social life, from the very beginning, acts in defence of class interests
  against the interests of the individual. To the extent that the personal
  interests of workers accord with those of the class, state regulation of these
  interests becomes unnecessary and they recede and wither away.

  In the economic sphere, apart from the continuous growth in the effectiveness
  of production, and the well-being linked to it, changes in the systems for the
  distribution of goods have a vital significance. The movement from
  distribution "according to work" to distribution "according to need" is
  brought about by means of the broadening of the fund for social consumption,
  by means of the distribution of entirely new categories of goods.

  No state institution can outstrip the level of the consciousness of the
  masses. For in their essence, they only fix an achieved level of consciousness
  to which the institutions respond with a delay. But the dynamic of
  restructuring is graphically illustrated when after definite changes in
  individual consciousness there follow changes in the entire system of
  administration which stimulate the rise of new changes and the consciousness
  of new tasks.

  As far as the primary source, the first cause, of changes in the consciousness
  of the proletarian masses is concerned the workers have nothing to learn from
  the capitalists. All such changes; the conscious discipline, the class
  approach to social phenomena, the self limitation in the consumption of goods,
  the consciousness of social interests as ones own; all this arises in
  proportion to the growth of the organization of the proletariat, in proportion
  to the consciousness of each worker of his membership in the class. These are
  produced in the course of the class struggle of the proletariat; they arise in
  form of ideas, are manifested in the class victories of the proletariat and
  are confirmed in the revolutionary changes in the consciousness of each
  worker.

  And here for the proletariat there is only one science, that of its own
  historical experience.

* The crisis of the working class movement
  Putting the investigation of capitalist society to one side, it might seem
  strange to discuss the tasks of the victorious proletariat now, when, more
  than half a century after the victory of the proletariat, there is such vast
  material for concrete historical analysis.

  And, truly, it would be pointless to declare that the preceding conclusions
  were arrived at without taking account of the recent history of the states in
  the socialist camp. On the contrary, although all the conclusions are drawn
  from the laws of historical development of society, from the laws of
  capitalist economy and the class struggle of the proletariat, obviously the
  starting point is the practice of socialism.

  The historical peculiarities of the formation of socialism in the various
  countries, permits bringing all the facts together in four groups;

  - Soviet Union, China, Albania.
  - Hungarian Soviet Republic (1919) and Chile (1970-1973).
  - Yugoslavia and Cuba.

  All remaining states in the socialist trend.

  Despite this localization of the socialist boundaries within the framework of
  nations, the point here is not the national but the political
  peculiarities. Thus it is not an error that Hungary appears in two groups, the
  second and the fourth, rather this corresponds to the significance of the
  experience at different historical stages.

  Into the first group go countries which made a real, positive contribution to
  the cause of socialism, independently encountering definite problems in the
  construction of socialism and contributing their experience in resolving
  them. The experience of the second group is also independent, but is a
  negative experience. The practice of the third group, generally speaking, lies
  to the side of the fundamental path of the socialist movement.

  The policies of Yugoslavia and Cuba were never seriously based on a Marxist
  foundation, they are eclectic. But their history can be examined as proving
  ground for testing some particular ideas. And, finally, the fourth group is
  made up of countries openly imitating, borrowing from others not just the
  useful experiences (there is nothing wrong with that, it is often worthwhile)
  but also the mistakes.

  The experience of the Soviet Union, of course, has the most significance,
  having been independent for its whole history. The experience of China from
  the mid fifties through the demise of Mao Tse-Tung is very important; the
  preceding period, in essence, was a repetition of the socialist development of
  the USSR, and with the death of Mao Tse-Tung everything fell into a familiar
  rut. The political life of Albania in turn, may present the most interest, but
  its closure and isolationism, make it hard to approach for analysis.

  The experience of the Hungarian Soviet Republic (1919) and Chile (1970 - 1973)
  agree in all fundamental features. In both cases, the socialist forces came to
  power peacefully; which, incidentally, attests to the overwhelming superiority
  of the left forces in some concrete historical circumstances. In both cases
  socialism perished, in the last analysis because of an underestimation of the
  organizing role of property. In both cases the socialist government made
  insufficient use of political terror, which is the proletariat's only
  available means for destruction of counterrevolutionary formations. The
  non-violent acquisition of power disposed the left forces to the view that the
  resistance of the bourgeoisie would not go beyond the democratic framework;
  this was an historic mistake. And when the bourgeoisie cast aside its
  democratic mask, the proletariat was simply insufficiently hardened and
  prepared for mortal class combat. Theorists, advocating the peaceful struggle
  of the proletariat for socialism, would do well to extract the obvious lesson
  from this. Until such time as the bourgeoisie is decisively weakened,
  including economically, in the struggle with world socialist forces, all hope
  for the bloodless victory of socialism remains utopian.

  Neither the acquisition of political power nor the rapid expropriation of
  capitalist property gives a reliable guarantee, for the expropriated property
  exerts its counterrevolutionary influence through the hope of its return,
  through calculation of the potential benefits from the restoration of
  ownership.

  While the bourgeoise remains economically powerful, the revolution can only
  secure itself through the iron terror of political dictatorship.

  Happily, the Russian revolution avoided these mistakes. The excesses of the
  aristocracy, the insolence of the landowners and the unruliness of the
  bourgeoisie, had prepared the workers for the sternest struggle. Thus the
  October revolution gave birth to an energetic and decisive dictatorship, which
  succeeded in holding its ground against both the internal and external, open
  enemies, and which fell from power a few decades later only as a result of
  completely different causes.

  The history of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the counterrevolution
  in Russia merits the most profound analysis, and will remain for many years
  the subject of scientific investigation. But the fundamental conclusions can
  and must be drawn immediately, for without them the workers movement finds
  itself at a dead end.

  The counterrevolution in the USSR proceeded so quietly and along such an
  unexpected paths that no one noticed it. The Administration of the USSR now
  had dictatorial power and, in the course of decades, succeeded in passing
  itself off as a Marxist-Leninist leadership, succeeded in fooling the workers
  by playing at democracy. Even the international communist movement, for the
  most part, did not get close to making a truly Marxist assessment of the
  events in Russia. But the counterrevolution occurred, and first of all, we
  must establish that, in fact, it was a revolution.

  In 1961 in the Program of the CPSU and thereafter, finally, in the
  Constitution of 1977, the tasks of the dictatorship of the proletariat were
  declared to have been fulfilled and the Soviet Union was advertised as a
  'state of the entire people.'

  But Marxists have always been clear that, while the victorious proletariat
  cannot, in general, make do without the state, this state can be nothing other
  than the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat. The point is not only
  that the proletariat is the only class capable of seizing for itself the
  production of all goods and the realization of all social tasks. The point is,
  also, that the proletariat is the only class which is not in a position to
  provide itself with goods by means of theft from other classes. Because of
  this, whatever the conditions turn out to be, the proletariat remains the only
  class striving for communism as the highest form of realization of its
  possibilities and satisfaction of its interests, and this striving is
  historically inevitable.

  Perhaps the 'state of the entire people' is the first rung on the ladder
  leading to the classless communist society?

  Classless society, like all societies, cannot exist without production. Yet if
  one shall produce while another only consumes, then the division into classes
  will have been maintained. Therefore a classless society can only be created
  based on the producing class. The proletariat is an open class, that is a
  class which can take anyone into its midst, without preconditions such as
  impractical demands and qualifications.

  It is the ruling, privileged situation of this open class which, alone, can
  exert a destructive influence on the remaining non-privileged layers of
  society, and by drawing them in to the midst of the proletariat, is capable of
  leading to a classless society.

  The "class harmony" of the 'state of the entire people' is possible only
  through the abandonment by the proletariat of its communist aims, through
  slavish agreement by the proletariat to work in the interests of other
  classes. That the "people's state" can have no other content than the
  bourgeois was made clear by both Engels and Lenin. For what else can be meant
  by the "union of the working class, the collective peasantry and the people's
  intelligentsia," if it arises after the proletariat has held undivided power
  and replaces the dictatorship of the proletariat?

  In the course of the proletariat's struggle for political supremacy, such a
  union could be spoken of as a convergence of interests at a definite stage of
  the struggle. After the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat,
  return to such a union can only mean that the proletariat cannot cope with
  power, that it is drawing the bourgeoisie toward power, that is has
  capitulated before them. The proletariat has always been oppressed for the
  sake of enriching the bosses, and this capitalist relation disappears only
  when it has become the omnipotent boss itself.

  Another hope: perhaps the formulation of the 'state of the entire people' is
  just a terminological mistake? History knows a number of cases when the most
  democratic banners covered up oppression and arbitrariness, when radical
  movements were forced to conceal themselves behind respectable slogans. So
  perhaps in the USSR a firm proletarian dictatorship is being concealed behind
  modest phrases about the "leading" role of the working class?

  No and no!

  Does the proletariat of the USSR participate in the distribution of goods?

  Does the whole class participate in drawing up and carrying out economic
  policy? No more than under capitalism! And here is the cardinal answer to the
  question. We will consider some more theses offered by way of proof of the
  special situation of the proletariat in the USSR, but we ought not to forget
  that these theses simply stock up the arsenal of tricks upon which the
  Administration relies in order to distract the proletariat from class struggle
  and to cloud its class consciousness.

  Universal suffrage. But such rights are enjoyed by the workers of almost all
  capitalist states and this does not hinder the bourgeoisie in the least from
  preserving its dictatorship.

  Workers representation in the organs of state power right up to the highest
  levels. Yes, here is one of the trump cards which the card sharps pull out
  every time when speaking about socialist democracy. But does this give the
  proletariat any real rights whatever?

  The capitalists prefer to seat jurists as the politicians in their
  parliaments. But does this signify the dictatorship of lawyers, a democracy
  for attorneys? The power, clearly, lies not with the representatives, but with
  those who dictate their demands to the representatives, those according to
  whose will the representatives are hired and fired.

  For the higher state organs of the USSR both the criterion for selection and
  the only right for workers and other representatives is to serve as a
  unanimous support for all proposals brought to them. Unanimity? Even this is
  secondary, it is excessive. What is important is whose proposals are adopted.

  So whose suggestions are they, who introduces them? These suggestions are
  introduced only by the highest organs of the CPSU. Reserving for themselves
  the absolute right to organize every and all elections, controlling means of
  mass ideological influence, the CPSU predetermines and dictates the results of
  the voting. The CPSU controls, and in essence predetermines all nomination of
  candidates, that is to say it directly supplies the composition of all elected
  bodies necessary to it.

  The CPSU subordinates to itself all executive systems from top to bottom and
  always and continuously sharpens them against dissenters. The CPSU decides
  everything.

  The leading role of the CPSU in all state affairs of the USSR is enshrined in
  the 1977 constitution. "The devotion of the party to the cause of the
  proletariat, to the ideas of Marxism-Leninism is proven by the
  self-sacrificing participation in all struggles which are the lot of
  Revolutionary Soviet Russia." But are such proofs a guarantee for all time?

  History would stop being history if a place in it could be found for this type
  of guarantee!

  There is one guarantee of loyalty to the cause of the proletariat. The Marxist
  party will remain Marxist so long as service to the proletariat remains for it
  not only the sole guiding idea but also the sole personal demand of members
  which must be satisfied in order to remain in the party.

  A party which is conducive to the satisfaction of other demands, such as the
  obtaining power, goods or special privileges, inevitably carries within it the
  seeds of opportunistic degeneration.

  The CPSU renounced the dictatorship of the proletariat not only in words but
  also in deeds. The working class, even that fraction of it that are members of
  the party, have absolutely no opportunity to influence the actions of leaders,
  the taking of high level decisions, the formulation of its theory, its
  propaganda or its conduct of social and economic policy.

  Why? Why in the cruel and dangerous revolutionary period was the party able to
  remain proletarian? Why in the years of economic construction did its
  relations with proletariat change so sharply?

  Because, as a part of the revolutionary opposition to the autocratic and
  bourgeois government, in conducting the armed struggle against
  counterrevolution, the party had only one method of work; raising the
  consciousness of the masses and mobilizing them, bringing to each the
  revolutionary significance of Marxist ideas. The spontaneous class control of
  the proletariat was exercised because ideas unacceptable to the workers,
  evoking no response in their consciousness and so rejected by the very
  indifference of the masses, were simply not taken up for implementation.

  Because in the following period, with immediate control of the state, the
  CPSU, in carrying out its policies no longer had any need for the mediation of
  the proletarian masses, and consequently, liberated itself from their
  control. In just this way, the party leadership, brought direct pressure to
  bear on the highest organs of the state, free from any control by the mass of
  rank and file party members.

  Under such conditions, no reason remained for the party bosses to act as
  spokesmen or defenders of the interests of the proletariat; these interests
  were inevitably crowded out by the personal interests of the bosses, for
  nothing stood in the way of satisfying their own interests at the expense of
  the proletariat.

  The party bosses could not rule without the support of definite social
  forces. The ruling class, the Administration, was just such a force, for the
  bosses promoted them and controlled all their decisions, they functioned
  entirely under their control.

  This ruling class had long since adapted itself to the party and state
  apparatus so that with silence and bribes, lies and coerced obedience, they no
  longer led the masses but commanded them; thus isolating themselves from the
  worrisome mass movement.

  Correspondingly, the Administration not only appropriated goods for the
  satisfaction of its own wants, but also supplied them to the entire
  administrative-party layer. And in the bowels of this bureaucratic system,
  once again under the supervision of the Administration, the questions of
  prices and wages are decided. Here too, the distribution of labour, that is to
  say how to supply the proletariat with the very minimum of goods which would
  maintain their obedience, is determined. Now the real boss is revealed; we see
  in whose interests, entirely without the class control of the proletarian
  mass, the entire management system functions.

  The counterrevolution had arrived.

  How and when did this revolution take place? What forces gave rise to it? Why
  did the revolution turn out to be so noiseless?

  Prerevolutionary Russia at the start of the 20th century was rich with
  struggling political tendencies. It was for the proletariat to assess them all
  and to choose one. And it correctly chose Bolshevism, singling it out as the
  trend which was the most consistent proponent of Marxist, and so proletarian,
  ideas.

  Here a part of the text is missing, a single manuscript page which is lost in
  the original. The remaining portion is as follows;

  "In the struggle to link up with the proletarian mass, for the introduction of
  Marxist-Leninist ideas, at the core of the party a group of authentic leaders
  formed whose personal recognition among the proletariat could rally not just
  the party ranks but also the entire class. It was not the principle of
  democratic centralism which brought these people to the fore, they were
  promoted from such groups, which they themselves had organized, whose original
  basis for formation was the approval and support of ideas held by the leaders
  ...

  ... and this was historically inevitable, since the ruling party no longer
  satisfied the criterion of service to the proletariat."

  -----

  The bourgeois tendency, having penetrated, could not announce itself at once,
  because at the centre of the party were to be found leaders, who had been
  evaluated and recognized by the proletariat before the revolution, who were
  still deciding the most important political questions. Lenin, and after his
  death Stalin, conducted politics in the interest of the proletariat. And at
  most lower levels of leadership there were still cadre who had been drawn in,
  trained and promoted in the revolutionary struggle. But time passed and,
  inevitably, they were replaced with other cadre attracted to the ruling
  position of the party.

  The efforts of the party developed all the links of the state system,
  including within its sphere of activities and direction the gigantic task of
  managing Russia. Accordingly, a fusing of the state apparatus and the party
  occurred at every link from top to bottom, and also, inevitably, in party
  ideological work, an ever larger place was occupied by the current management
  tasks of the state.

  The continued conduct of proletarian policies was a mitigating factor, but, in
  many and quite decisive forms, this fusion defined the atmosphere in the
  continuous political discussions at the very centre of the party. Victory in
  the struggle had predetermined the support of the proletarian mass and this
  obstructed the leaders from connecting with the mood of the masses.

  In turn, the proletariat had the opportunity to choose the leaders, single
  them out according to their positions and engage them in discussion; this was
  the very best form for expressing the interests of the proletariat, even if it
  was only with the narrow circle which constituted the party centre. It is no
  coincidence that Stalin, with his profound grasp of Marxist theory,
  continuously participated in such discussions and was always ready to decide
  questions by appealing to the proletariat.

  The conditions for discussion within the party intensified political
  development and the growth of the party ranks. But they also acted on the
  state apparatus in a very disorganizing form, since it was drawn into these
  discussion through the solid links that had been forged. The more management
  was stabilized, the more these harmful activities became noticeable.

  In 1935-1937 the opposition was decisively removed from the party. This had a
  number of important consequences.

  Firstly, the party-state system acquired an extremely monolithic character,
  which perhaps was the only thing permitting the USSR to withstand the battle
  with fascism.

  Secondly, the proletariat was completely deprived of the possibility of
  putting forward leaders or of influencing their nomination; from this moment,
  the interests of the proletariat were defended only to the extent that they
  were represented by Stalin personally,

  Thirdly, Stalin lost the possibility of verifying his political decisions
  though the support of the masses.

  At this point the dictatorship of the proletariat had still not ended its
  existence, for, to the extent of his abilities, Stalin was devoted to the
  interests of the proletariat and unwaveringly embodied them in his
  policies. However, the conditions for the reproduction of the dictatorship of
  the proletariat were completely lost; it was fated to die with the death of
  Stalin.

  The years 1935 to 1953 were a period if not of a dead, then of a dying
  dictatorship of the proletariat.

  Why was it that succeeding events were unable to produce a leader that was
  Stalin's equal, if not his superior, in defending the interests of the
  proletariat?

  At this time the structure of society in the USSR was already such that
  proletarian democracy, the free will of the organized proletariat, had been
  completely excluded. The monolithic party-state apparatus was now suitable
  only for the implementation of ideas from the top down, having at its disposal
  all the means of direct repression, full control of all means of mass
  ideological influence and complete control of all social
  organizations. Naturally, this apparatus had no intention whatsoever of
  tolerating the dissemination of any ideas harmful to its interests, however
  necessary they might be to the proletariat. And all ideas expressing the
  interest of the proletariat brought danger with them, since at the very least,
  they demanded action and continuous effort directed at the achievement of the
  proletariat's aims. On the other hand the apparatus was quite ready to act in
  its personal interest, broadening its rights, perquisites and privileges,
  while not burdening itself with additional duties.

  In these conditions the proletariat had neither the possibility of organizing,
  nor the opportunity to select a new leader, for the leaders upholding
  proletarian ideas, had not the least opportunity to arrange a mass link to the
  proletariat. Besides which, it is quite obvious that the consciousness of
  society, the consciousness of the proletariat was absolutely unprepared to
  perceive or recognize such general and extremely numerous significant changes,
  so focused was it on the leader's death. With horrifying impassivity, society
  became carried away with reprisals against the last Marxist revolutionary and
  the libelous campaign to expose the cult of the personality.

  Such a swift and terrible revolution had no parallel in history, and some
  historical distance was necessary in order to develop the required evaluation
  in the consciousness of society.

  The party-state bosses, the Administration, separated from the proletariat by
  a layer of secondary administrative executors now had the opportunity to
  promote leaders from their midst and, corresponding to their interests, to
  change them (M. Malenkov, N. S. Kruschev) until such time as they settled on
  the most suitable. Liberating themselves from the dictatorship of the
  proletariat, they rapidly demonstrated that they did not intend to recognize
  any dictatorship in general, that in the future they would dictate, to
  whatever leader, the fundamental direction of policy. It is no accident that
  L. I. Brezhnev arrived at his post under the slogan "Stop shaking up the
  cadre, give people the opportunity to work peacefully." This was the
  guarantee, essential to the bosses, of the stability of their situation.

  The counterrevolution had taken place. In accordance with their profoundly
  capitalist essence, they transformed the social structure, giving it quite
  novel characteristics. Relations between the Administration and the workers
  were instantly degraded to a feudal level. Sovereignty over the distribution
  of goods together with sovereign ownership of the entire peoples economy,
  liberated the Administration from the burden of any type of competitive
  economic pressure; this meant that the pursuit of maximal profits and the
  accompanying development of production had become unnecessary for them.

  The worries of the administration were reduced to this; allowing their serfs
  to feed themselves, in order to provide for the reproduction of labour power,
  but only after they had completely satisfied the wants of the bosses - the
  Administration.

  At the same time, the distribution of the goods expropriated from the
  proletariat, amongst the bosses and within the dictatorial administration, led
  to a piling up of complications left over from the previous stage of
  development of the state, which however had now become purely formal
  demands. The inevitable struggle for the distribution of goods within the
  administrations itself, therefore took on a petty-bourgeois, penny-pinching
  character, when for the sake of trivial gains, millions upon millions were
  destroyed since they belonged to "nobody" and could not be converted into
  personal property. This unnatural situation was pregnant with permanent
  crisis, the resolution of which led, every time, step by step, to the
  revelation and legalization of its capitalist essence, i.e. to bring the form
  into correspondence with the content.

  This strange, never before observed, form of capitalism gave rise to many
  delusions, both within the country and beyond its borders. This was greatly
  assisted by the lack of an authentic model of socialism for comparison, by
  broad propaganda (inside the country it was generally overwhelming) for the
  pseudo-marxist theoretical fabrications of the bosses, and by the isolation
  and separation of the socialist world from capitalist problems. This last was
  interpreted as a particularity of socialism, but was in fact preordained by
  the feudal structure. But in spite of all the window dressing, the extravagant
  beautification and commentary, capitalism remains capitalism.

  If we imagine a staunch Marxist, accidentally finding himself at the head of
  the CPSU and utterly determined to return the country to the path of communist
  development, the path of following the interests of the proletariat, then we
  can also imagine the insuperable difficulties which would lie before him, what
  resistance would be offered by the Administration. Even if this leader had the
  support of the masses available, he would hardly be able to effect decisive
  change since the jealous Administration would build a wall to cut off all
  possibilities of organized contact with them.

  Of course, no Marxist could ever, even accidentally, find himself at the head
  of the fully developed systems in the USSR. Yet history does afford the
  opportunity to examine such a situation through factual material. For Mao
  Tse-Tung found himself in exactly this situation.

  Up until the mid fifties, the political development in China had repeated, at
  an accelerated tempo, the experience of the USSR. Perhaps there were other
  reasons, or perhaps it was the events connected with the appearance in the
  political arena of N. S. Kruschev, that compelled Mao Tse-Tung to wonder about
  the soundness of a system capable of producing such activities within the
  highest levels of leadership. Analysis of the situation in China confirmed the
  terrible danger; with a few national deviations, which, incidentally,
  aggravated the situation, the Chinese system was a copy of the Russian
  one. And in China, the alienation of the party from the masses was clearly
  revealed, shaping their clan of bosses with the characteristics of a parasitic
  organism.

  Obviously, as with any compromise of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie,
  such degeneration can only be managed and then overcome only on the
  revolutionary road, only through the mobilization of the masses for
  revolutionary struggle. The moment at which such a revolution could have been
  a continuation of what had gone before had already slipped by. This posed a
  dilemma; whether to go below in order to organize a new revolutionary
  movement, or to make maximum use of his personal situation, popularity and
  continuing control over the administrative system to raise the revolutionary
  consciousness of the masses. This dilemma, under the concrete conditions, had
  for Mao a unique rational solution. And he energetically took up its
  implementation.

  The policy of the "Great Leap Forward" was a policy of kindling the initiative
  of the masses, awakening their consciousness of their relationship to current
  events along a comparatively "peaceful" road. The awakening of consciousness
  would give hope of a development toward proletarian control over the
  management system; but the policy did not meet with success. Obedience rather
  than recognition remained the decisive factor.

  Then the "Cultural Revolution" was a direct appeal for reprisals against the
  bureaucracy that was forming, an attempt to demonstrate to the masses with
  cruel facts that they were really in a ruling position in the country, that in
  their collective actions they were all powerful. Then, in the end, when this
  process too had failed to produce decisive revolutionary change, there was
  special attention to the theory of regular revolutionary shocks, to the
  teachings of Marx on the continuity of revolution right up to communism.

  Mao Tse-Tung did not succeed in stirring up a new wave of revolution; an
  unnecessary reminder that revolution cannot be made to order. And what he
  accomplished for the raising of the consciousness of the Chinese proletariat
  is difficult to assess. The situation in China was destabilized, and after the
  death of Mao this produced a continuation of consciousness raising, for it
  necessitated seeking support for chosen positions. Even if this process did
  not burst out in a new revolutionary wave, and the authorities succeeded in
  stabilizing the situation in the country, the memory of the "Cultural
  Revolution" will, again and again, give rise to flashes of the revolutionary
  mood.

  The death of Mao Tse-Tung for China, just as the death of Stalin for the USSR,
  signified the end of the period of proletarian dictatorship. The first great
  wave of proletarian revolutions, which had lasted sixty years, was over; the
  world wide crisis of the workers movement had arrived.

  What has the experience of the existence of the dictatorship of the
  proletariat in these two powerful countries taught us?

  First, that the victory of the socialist revolution and even the full
  establishment of the proletarian dictatorship, linked with the liquidation of
  the bourgeoisie as a class, is not a guarantee of the final turn toward
  communism. If the proletariat cannot find the ability to take upon itself the
  fulfillment of the most important social functions, if it cannot discover the
  organizational form, permitting the control of the distribution of goods by
  the whole class, then the bourgeoisie will be reborn again and again, and will
  occupy, once more, its privileged position in society.

  Second, capitalism proved its vitality, proved that it exists, like a virus,
  in any socialist society, ready to conduct its quiet struggle for the global
  liquidation of revolution, for the degeneration of its system and for a
  noiseless victory. This is to be understood in the following way; the
  administrative intelligentsia, to which the proletariat necessarily entrusts
  some important social functions, will shake off control, form itself as a
  class and this class will be bourgeois.

  Third, the important link between the fundamental categories of the
  proletarian movement was revealed. It had long been clear that proletarian
  democracy was unthinkable without the dictatorship of the proletariat; but the
  history of the proletarian state also proves the opposite, that the
  dictatorship of the proletariat cannot exist without proletarian democracy.

  The proletariat carried the tasks of the seizure of power and its defence
  against open enemies on its shoulders. But then a new task came to the fore;
  the maintenance of the battle-readiness of the dictatorship of the proletariat
  in the corrosive environment of commodity-money relations.

  It turns out that the proletariat cannot completely trust any social force
  whatever, even arising in the very midst of the proletariat. In order to
  realize its control over them it is absolutely essential to maintain a
  definite level of self-directed organization of the proletariat as a whole,
  which is always capable of all-proletarian class activity against any
  individual forces, including against the state.

  Communism is a society of the very highest yet entirely self-directed
  organization; its only source is the self-directed organization of the working
  class, shaping mass activity. This means that in order to firmly fix upon the
  path leading to communism, it still remains for the proletariat to lift itself
  one more rung toward the highest levels of consciousness. Having won important
  victories in the battle with capitalism, the proletariat then suffered a no
  less crushing defeat in the silent battle. Nowhere is the proletariat so
  deprived of rights as in the socialist countries, where all workers
  organizations are subjected to the cruelest control of the ruling class, where
  truly, they find themselves in servitude under the ruling bosses and where
  disagreement and any self-directed activity is ruthlessly suppressed. Nowhere
  else does the ruling class appropriate to itself, with such effrontery, the
  exclusive right to represent the entire people. Nowhere else do the media so
  relentlessly drum into the proletariat's head that it is precisely this that
  is in the proletariat's own interests. Nowhere else does the material
  situation of the working class exhibit such a glaring disparity with the level
  of production. Nowhere besides the socialist countries, do they preach such
  hypocritical words about the growth of material well-being and cultural
  development to a proletariat so impoverished and so lacking in rights. Nowhere
  else do they intone such sanctimonious appeals to virtue and labour heroism,
  nor spout with such outrageous cynicism the hallowed slogans of Marxism.

  The crisis of the socialist movement lead to the degeneration of proletarian
  socialism into the very ugliest form of socialism; the rotten, predatory
  jackal-socialism of the administrative bosses who steal from the proletariat
  not only for the satisfaction of their personal consumption and for the
  appropriation of wealth but also in order to destroy anything that remains. In
  prosecuting its petty-bourgeois, internecine struggle over the booty, the
  ruling class hardly worries about what will be left over for the
  proletariat. With its bad management, indifference and devil may care
  attitude, it transforms to nothing or lets rot unbelievable quantities of the
  labour invested by the proletariat.

  ...That, which they cover with beautiful phrase "according to Marx and
  according to Lenin," that, upon which they base their theoretical
  elaborations, their "renewals" of Marxism, should lead no one into
  delusion. And capitalism, whatever form it might take, never neglects any
  means of ideological pressure in its struggle against the growth of the
  proletarian masses. And this new bourgeois-feudal form of socialism will
  never, in anything vital, retreat from its capitalist essence.

  Both Marx and all his true followers conducted the struggle not simply for
  socialism but for proletarian socialism; which means all power to the
  proletariat and democracy for the proletariat. The proletariat must always
  understand that its own, undisputed and undivided dictatorship is the
  obligatory condition for progress, for the development of society toward
  communism.

  -----

  In the twentieth century, like it or not, the workers movement of the whole
  world came under the decisive influence of the events in the socialist
  countries.

  The victory of the proletariat in the October revolution produced a rise in
  the revolutionary movement in countries even very far removed from Russia,
  assisted in the birth of many communist parties and in the implanting of
  Marxist ideas in various working class movements. These revolutionary birth
  pangs swept over all the continents, yet nowhere was the proletariat
  sufficiently organized, sufficiently powerful to seize and hold power. After a
  series of retreats, the bourgeoisie was able to retake and hold their
  positions. The international development of the revolutionary process was
  halted.

  The victory of the proletarian revolution in Russia served, for the
  international proletariat, as a powerful emotional jolt which particularly
  assisted in initiating a mood of extreme leftism. Such activity could not be
  long-lived.

  The wreck of ultra-left adventures, insufficiently prepared to deal with the
  real situation, brought about a sobering up and demanded from the working
  class a more profound assessment. This was assisted by events developing in
  Russia itself. With the rebirth in the USSR of some forms of capitalist
  relations (NEP), with a return by the proletariat to a policy of concessions,
  clarity was lost and their perceptions moved from the emotional to the
  analytic sphere. An ever greater role was played by the assessment of the
  economic successes of the USSR; but this development was significantly
  retarded by the destruction brought about by the Civil and then the World War,
  together with the complications of the revolutionary process itself.

  The socialist construction in the USSR continued to stimulate the interest of
  all workers, but now this was as a grand experiment, on the results of which
  depended the direction of their own activities and their energy in the class
  struggle.

  The heroic resistance of the Soviet peoples to German fascism and their
  complete victory over it brought a new emotional impetus to the international
  proletarian movement and aroused powerful class solidarity. But the associated
  activities of the proletariat did not have a directly revolutionary
  direction. The energetic resistance to fascism influenced support for the
  USSR. The international proletarian forces powerfully defended its right to
  the socialist experiment and defended their own interest in a general
  verification of Marxist ideas on a practical level, in the experiences of the
  socialist state in the USSR. But, in the Second World War, the USSR sustained
  enormous material losses, which again necessitated attention to the renewal of
  its economy to make good this set back in economic development. The
  appearance, in the postwar period, of the countries of peoples democracy in
  the socialist camp, broadened the framework of the experiment but brought no
  change in its essence.

  It is no accident that the fundamental centre of the revolutionary movement in
  the following period shifted to the liberation of countries under the yoke of
  colonialism. Their economic backwardness frequently permitted no hope of
  success in bourgeois competitive struggle, while the socialist path protected
  them against the most ruthless exploitation. However, it was also no accident
  that among them, those possessing a sufficiently developed national
  bourgeoisie chose the path of cooperation with the capitalist world and did
  not meet with especially great resistance on the part of their working class.

  Such an, if you like "abnormal," theoretically unforeseen shift of the
  revolution from the most developed countries to the most backward, enables the
  insight that the decisive factor for the energy of the revolutionary
  proletarian movement of the entire world, at the contemporary historical
  stage, is the economic situation of the workers in the socialist countries,
  and in the first place in the USSR.

  The stimulus to activity of humanity is controlled by two factors; the
  desirability of the aims and an assessment of the cost of achieving
  them. Whether we like it or not, the energy of the proletarian class and its
  readiness for revolutionary activity is defined in this way. Besides the
  constructiveness of the leading ideas, i.e. their suitability for embodiment
  in the practical activities of the proletariat, we must look at the
  significance and richness of the results to which they lead, that is at the
  changes in the political, economic and social circumstances of the workers.

  If, at the start of the 20th century, it was the differences between the
  economic, political and social situations of the proletariat and the
  bourgeoisie which could act as a measure of the revolutionization of the
  proletariat, after the victory of October the measure became the comparison of
  the position of the workers under capitalist and socialist conditions. This is
  why the development of the socialist economy became the decisive factor in the
  world revolutionary movement.

  The loss of the proletarian dictatorship, the bourgeois degeneration of the
  socialist camp and the rebirth within it of feudal relations continued to be
  hidden from the proletariat of the entire world. The consequences of this
  degeneration were pushed as the unique, utterly "Marxist" development of the
  proletariat's victory by the mutual efforts of both the bourgeois and the
  socialist propaganda machines. And although the Chinese propagandists expended
  considerable effort to disclose the actual situation, their declarations were
  less authoritative because of the economic backwardness of China itself. The
  position of workers in the USSR continued to be perceived by the proletarians
  of all countries as the normal results of Marxist ideas. It is hardly
  surprising that for the workers of the advanced capitalist countries any
  struggle for the achievement of such a result produced little revolutionary
  enthusiasm.

  The leaders of the communist parties of the advanced capitalist countries long
  since understood the unpopularity among the proletarian masses of any ideas
  tied to a repetition of the Russian experience. However, instead of exposing
  the facts to a Marxist analysis, instead of separating the tasks and direction
  of proletarian revolution from the mistakes and perversions which led to the
  wreck of the dictatorship of the proletariat, instead of deepening the theory,
  the communist parties themselves took up a superficial propagandist posture,
  occupied opportunist positions and began to feel "liberated from Marxism." The
  economic slowing down of the socialist countries, in comparison to the
  definite successes of the most developed countries of the capitalist camp,
  gave rise among the proletariat itself in the less developed countries to a
  tendency and social movement in the direction of "improving and perfecting"
  the capitalist system. This tendency has nothing in common with either Marxism
  or the interests of the proletariat, but was precisely what was exploited by
  the largest communist parties such as the French and the Italians, among
  others. It was precisely this tendency which served as the foundation for the
  "new models" of socialism, which gave rise to the vast pseudo-marxist
  "theoretical" literature and which was the source and support of the
  pseudocommunist propaganda.

  This meant not just a crisis in proletarian ideology, but also a worldwide
  crisis of philosophy and political economy generally. In our times, the period
  of the universal crisis of capitalism, the political formations in the world
  are changing at an ever increasing speed, for capitalism is obliged to
  continually invent newer and newer tricks to safeguard itself from final
  collapse. In these condition, any idealist philosophical system is smashed to
  bits by the sharp turns of reality. Moreover any predictions it makes are
  inevitably wrong; whereas those founded on an improved point of view, on
  materialism, receive immediate confirmation. Thus, no positive platform can
  ever appear justified nor will it be given time to prove its
  justifiability. On the contrary, it is negative justifiability and
  construction by refutation which are invariably affirmed. It is no accident
  that, more and more frequently, elaborations of a "philosophy of universal
  negation" burst out into print, sometimes embellished with confused practical
  recommendations expressing the author's desires.

  On the other hand, there remains the unique theory capable of understanding
  and explaining all the twists and turns of capitalist society.

  This theory is Marxism.

  It is understandable the ruling class avoids it, for it continues to predict
  its downfall. The causes of the unpopularity of Marxism among the critical
  left are less obvious. But this results from the attempt, using a Marxist,
  materialist, interpretation of the present, to comprehend, on this basis, the
  conformity to law of the existing socialist countries, that is to comprehend
  them as conformiing to the laws of socialist development. Instead of revealing
  their capitalist essence, instead of seeing them as extraordinarily
  complicated, intricate, camouflaged forms, it subjects Marxism to a violent
  distortion; it "improves" and "enriches" it to such an extent that it can
  accommodate the countries of the socialist camp in the framework of a
  presentation of socialist theory.

  After this sort of "improvement," Marxist theory, has become such a useless
  instrument, that with its help it is possible to prove the socialist character
  of the bourgeois state, the harmony of classes under capitalism and that the
  intelligentsia is now the seat of revolution. It can prove anything you like;
  but it is of absolutely no use to anyone for interpreting the processes that
  are really going on in the world.

  Thus arise countless constructions of "true," "orthodox," "authentic" Marxism,
  which are remarkable for their renunciation of the key principle of Marxism,
  its materialist foundations and their incorporation of mountains of idealist
  junk, beginning with the ethical foundation of Marxism and ending with a
  "Marxified" fideism. But this only replenishes the ranks of the countless
  idealist theories which are mercilessly smashed to bits by life.

  If the underdeveloped countries are still capable of waging a struggle,
  motivated by their striving to overcome their own backwardness, then the
  remainder of humanity is living through a great social crisis. This crisis
  combines the universal crisis of capitalism, the crisis of philosophy, the
  crisis of Marxism and the crisis of the workers movement. A crisis of this
  depth arises because while capitalism has almost completely exhausted the
  social resources needed to maintain its existence, it turns out that the only
  real alternative, socialism, is bankrupt. This bankruptcy lies in the
  inability of socialism to provide convincing proof to the masses of its
  superiority.

  The fact that this crisis is a crisis engendered by a mass delusion, that
  proletarian socialism cannot demonstrate its superiority for a unique, yet
  valid reason, namely that it does not exist in reality, but is thought by the
  deluded imagination to exist, this fact will not quickly be recognized by
  humanity.

  What is needed is a decisive argument. And such an argument, opening up a way
  out of the protracted social crisis, can only be the establishment, in one
  country, of an authentic dictatorship of the proletariat which realizes its
  economic superiority and on this basis achieves a fundamental change in the
  position of the workers. Only the very obvious form of a marked break in the
  political, economic and social situation of the workers can revolutionize the
  proletariat of the advanced capitalist countries, indicating to them the path
  of struggle.

  At the present time, once more, only one country, Russia, is capable of taking
  upon itself this historic mission. The revolutionization of the Russian
  proletariat, and once again, this is dictated by the difference in situation
  of the working and ruling classes, has already reached a socially decisive
  level, and continues to grow. The deepening crisis of the Soviet economy
  urgently demands a recovery of the vision which would permit a restoration of
  the dictatorship of the proletariat. But the proletariat in Russia is weakly
  organized; it is extremely difficult for it to organize and to exchange
  ideas. If the moment for the repetition of the proletarian revolution slips
  by, then the crisis in Russia will conclude with the commonplace
  transformation through the loss of stability in the state economy. This will
  hardly assist the conduct of proletarian political struggle and will relegate
  Russia to the faceless ranks of the second rate capitalist powers.

  History is not so generous as to grant the proletariat the certainty of
  decisive victory. But defeat and failure will also enable the accumulation of
  priceless experience, the development of the theoretical worldview and of
  proletarian class consciousness, and thus, consequently, the overcoming of
  future delusions on the path to final victory.

* Proletarian Dictatorship & Proletarian Democracy
  Having achieved political victory, that is to say the firm seizure of power,
  the proletariat, in the most fundamental way, changes the essence of all
  values in society. The means of production, the fund for consumption, the
  land, the riches of nature, artistic products and monuments; all these become
  the property of the proletariat. They become its property immediately, without
  waiting for nationalization or whatever acts of confiscation and transfer, at
  the very moment of the seizure of power.

  Apparently however, history is ready to leave behind facts contradicting this
  seizure. It produces the proletarian revolution, yet maintains a
  petty-bourgeois, peasant economy, which produces and sells the goods of
  craftsmen. The owners of enterprises which have not been nationalized continue
  their pursuit of profits ... Yes, all this is so. But it is only a form, an
  appearance, a shadow of the capitalism of the past.

  At the moment of proletarian victory, the fundamental law of socialism comes
  into force. The victorious proletariat, for the sake of maintaining the
  functional integrity of society, needs the activity of very varied layers of
  the population, and therefore, must stimulate such activities. The essence of
  property is radically changed by the proletarian victory, but the
  consciousness of people is incapable of responding to the victory with changes
  at the same rate. This consciousness is still unprepared to recognize new
  stimuli, in it bourgeois concepts still live, it continues to assess the
  results of activities only with bourgeois measures and to strive for bourgeois
  individualistic aims.

  The proletariat must reckon with this. The form of profits, the form of their
  defence in law; this is how the activity of those layers of the population, as
  yet unready for the socialist reorientation, are stimulated. This is neither
  capitalism nor a remnant of it. It is simply a superficial similarity, an
  external simulation of capitalist relations in the form of stimuli understood
  by definite segments of society, which draw them in to activity useful to
  society. This form of stimulation can be supplanted by another form. It can
  also be generally abolished, if the proletariat can either take upon itself or
  generally liberate itself from the functions fulfilled by such layers of
  society. This form can change where this is advantageous to the proletariat,
  where it corresponds to its interests and for so long as it continues to
  correspond to them.

  Everything is subordinate to the interests of the proletariat. Such is the
  legal foundation of socialist society. All other legislation is its direct
  consequence. And when discussions are raised about democracy for
  non-proletarian layers, there is no point in searching for support in
  historical precedent (there just isn't any). The proletariat must not share
  real power with anyone. Whatever democratic opportunities for the expression
  of the opinions and interests of non-proletarian groups and classes are
  permitted, this is only in order that, by taking stock of these interests and
  changes in them, a dynamic restructuring of the system of stimuli can take
  place. This permits the direction of the activities of the non-proletarian
  strata toward maximal effectiveness in the service of the proletariat. Thus
  the dictatorship of the proletariat must not, even to the slightest extent, be
  taken as a political system which provides authentic democracy to any class or
  layer except the proletariat itself. In questions of law and politics, in
  economic and social decisions, the proletarian dictatorship must be
  self-consciously a true, sovereign dictatorship. It must rule in the exclusive
  interests of the proletariat, through the provision and elimination of
  specific freedoms for the non-proletarian strata, exactly as in the question
  of the liquidation of private property in the means of production.

  This does not mean unbridled arbitrariness or monarchist autonomy in relations
  with the non-proletarian strata. Recklessness is not in the interests of the
  proletariat; the proletarian dictatorship must carefully nurture conditions
  for all strata which lead to the highest level of efficiency in activities
  useful to the proletariat. Just as in its care and concern, so too in its
  limitation and repression, the proletariat must be guided by the interests of
  the class, not concerning itself in the least with the interests of other
  strata.

  The socialist system is the highest form of democracy not because it is
  prepared to grant the bourgeois right of universal suffrage or definite
  bourgeois privileges to the intelligentsia, but because, for the first time in
  history, the ruling class is an open class. Each member of society has the
  opportunity of joining this class and of obtaining all the attendant
  privileges and of taking upon himself all the corresponding
  responsibilities. The unique real form of democracy in socialist society is
  democracy for the proletariat, and this is all that is required to ensure its
  gradual transformation into a society without classes. Proletarian democracy
  will then become democracy for all.

  Proletarian democracy is the unique class democracy which transforms itself
  into democracy for all. But for this to take place it is absolutely essential
  that the proletariat remain the ruling class, for it is the only open class of
  all the classes in history which has conducted a struggle for the mastery of
  society. And further, the dictatorship of the proletariat along all paths to
  communist society must not only, unavoidably, win the struggle with other
  classes, but must suppress the birth and development of all other classes so
  long as the conditions for such birth and development exist in society.

  So what is such a proletarian dictatorship?

  How must the working class realize its dictatorship?

  To say that this dictatorship is state power is insufficient. Yes, the
  socialist state can be nothing other than the revolutionary dictatorship of
  the proletariat. But the state and the proletariat are distinct, diffrently
  organized social subjects.  In order that their interests coincide, if only
  for a short historical period, the following conditions are necessary.

  The state and a class dictatorship are also dissimilar in other ways. The
  state, as a certain type of mechanism, is a means of implementing a
  dictatorship, a directing and compelling influence on society. But in order
  that this means can be the instrument of any given class, one that rules
  society in the interest of this class, it is essential that it is precisely
  this class, and not its individual representatives, that holds the key levers
  and forces in its hands, thus compelling the state to take up the interests of
  this class as its own.

  A class dictatorship is a system of social relations which provides the ruling
  class with control over society; including the suppression of the political
  initiative of any other classes which threaten their dictatorship.

  The bourgeoisie promotes the most democratic principles for the formation of
  state power and transfers to the state colossal financial resources in the
  form of taxes on profits, never fearing that this can be turned against
  them. It demands from the state just one thing; the unquestioning defence of
  private property. In property lies its strength. For is is precisely property,
  through its organizing effects, by conferring the right to decide the
  distribution of goods and by providing the hired organizations of the
  bourgeoisie with their very livelihood, which guarantees the bourgeoisie their
  ruling position, their control over the state.

  The proletariat, as the aggregate of the workers, generally has no opportunity
  to construct its dictatorship on an analagous basis. The proletariat is poor
  and no one pays any attention to them in the decisions of the state. Like the
  slaves in ancient Rome, rising against one slaveowner only to be enslaved by
  another, like the peasants in Russia rioting for the "good tsar," so too the
  proletariat, in creating an authority and then entrusting to it the
  distribution of costs and benefits and releasing all means of control over it,
  itself promotes new bosses, a new bourgeoisie. This is how it was, and ever
  would be, were it not for one condition. This condition, arising from the
  social character of production, is the capability of the proletariat for
  self-organization.

  For it is precisely the capability of the proletariat for self organization,
  which at a definite historical stage, permits the proletariat to fill the
  bosses shoes. But in the realization of this capability, the proletariat
  ceases to be simply an aggregate of workers; it acts as a class, as an
  integral social subject, and in this way becomes the irresistible force in
  society. Emerging victorious from the class struggle, the proletariat, again
  as an integral subject, becomes the owner of all the riches of society. But
  managing them in the bourgeois fashion, utilizing them directly in their own
  subjective class interests, is simply impossible. For this, it is necessary to
  build a sufficiently complex social system out of the materials bequeathed to
  it by history and on the basis of the relations prevailing in society at the
  given moment. But these relations must be restructured and reshaped so as to
  provide a guarantee of the dictatorship of the proletariat as a class. A
  system of social relations, operating through the abilities of the proletariat
  for self-organization, having as its foundation the self-directed, organized
  proletariat, can exist only if, in the course of its operation, it results in
  the satisfaction of definite proletarian interests. But these interests are
  precisely the merging of organizational and collective interests, of interests
  having a social character, into the class interest. In this system, the state
  plays the role of the social mechanism which compels and stimulates the
  purposeful activity of individuals through the strivings of personal,
  individualistic interests, and regulates the satisfaction of these desires
  depending on such activity. From this it is easy to see that, if the state
  locks up this role entirely, basing itself on just this set of functions, it
  will begin to function in the interests of its own apparatus, and this
  apparatus will transform itself into a parasitic organism, compelling society
  to serve it. As a result, it will cease to satisfy those interests of the
  workers which have a social character, it will cease to satisfy their
  spiritual needs, and this will lead to the weakening of the self-organization
  of the proletariat and directly assist the formation of the highest levels of
  the bureaucratic state apparatus into a ruling class exploiting the working
  mass.

  The task of the organized revolutionary proletariat is not to permit such an
  isolation, such a cutting off of the state. The proletariat must utilize the
  state mechanism to carry out the will of the class. It must play on the
  individualistic interests of the members of society and direct their activity
  to the satisfaction of social interests, in order to consolidate in social
  relations and in the consciousness of individuals an appreciation of the
  demands and interests of society. And for this to be possible, for it to
  become a reality, the proletariat finds itself confronting an array of other
  problems. These include cutting off any self-activity of the state directed
  against the proletariat. They include changing the functions of the state and
  changing the tasks placed before it according to the changing and developing
  interests of the proletariat. They also include, the categorical removal from
  the state of the slightest opportunity to hinder the free development of
  proletarian interests. Without a solution to these problems, without the
  construction of an entire system of relations which secure the consistent
  realization of the proletarian interest in a developing, revolutionizing,
  renewing society, any talk of proletarian dictatorship can only be hot air.

  The state stands opposed to society, and in this opposition it possesses
  considerable advantages. Even the bourgeois state, the economic possibilities
  of which are shaped by the wills of the capitalists, and which has at its
  disposal colossal quantities of goods, distributes a vital share of the social
  wealth. The socialist state takes upon itself the distribution of all goods,
  and in society there is not and cannot be anything comparable to the state by
  this measure. And this means that the entire might of the hired social
  organizations is directed to the defence of the interests of the state. In
  such conditions, how can society defend itself from exploitation by the state?

  Well the state has its weaknesses. Above all it is a paid organization, it is
  stimulated by material goods, and this means that the activities of the
  members of the separate links in this mechanism, in defence of their common
  interests, are defeated by their economic dependence and because such
  attitudes are not dictated by their basic interests. Secondly, each member of
  the state apparatus does not simply obtain the opportunity to appropriate some
  quantity of goods, these are provided to him under definite conditions and, in
  this sense he is under the control of society. Thirdly, the very system which
  the state mechanism organizes is formed not by the state but by the whole of
  society; thus, under definite conditions, it stands ahead of every member of
  the state apparatus and dictates the interest of society.

  Weaknesses there are, and these weaknesses must be used by proletarian society
  to maintain control over the proletarian state, but this is not so easy. The
  spontaneous activity of the proletariat in exercising this control cannot be
  guaranteed. The state then immediately slips out from under control and
  restructures itself to eliminate the weak spots. So that the control of
  society over the state can be effective, society must oppose the state with
  such a force as will be able to cut off all attempts by the state to
  restructure in isolation from the social system, as will be able to hinder the
  state's striving to liberate its links from social control, and, in the end,
  as will be able to destroy the entire state system, if that system refuses to
  subordinate personal improvement to social interests.

  Society must oppose the state with organization. And such organization can
  only be the self-directed organization of the proletarian mass, a firmer
  organization than that based on the unity of fundamental interests of the
  workers.

  Society must oppose to the state the organized, self-directed, proletarian
  party.

  The self-directed proletarian party is the form of proletarian
  self-organization with the aid of which the state mechanism can be forced to
  serve the interests of the proletariat, to be the means for the realization of
  the dictatorship of the proletariat.

  Here is the key. The party must be self-directed, that is to say both
  voluntary, attracting people exclusively thanks to their collectivist, social
  interests and not through the promise of any personal advantage, and bound by
  conscious discipline and personal enthusiasm. The party must be proletarian,
  for only the particular relationship of the proletariat to the aggregate
  social product provides a guarantee of the distribution of goods and labour in
  the interests of the whole of society. And it must be a party, for only a
  party can guarantee an integral policy, a unified world view monitoring all
  links of the state mechanism, only a party is capable of organizing and
  directing the activities of the masses to the change and improvement of this
  mechanism.

  But this is still not everything. Such a party, with the most powerful
  organization and enjoying the support of the proletarian masses, necessarily
  must have the possibility of taking upon itself all and absolute power, all
  control of society.

  Here is what it must not do! The party must remain in opposition to the state,
  it must act on the state only through the proletarian masses. In other words,
  every party decision must be evaluated by the support of the whole class, by
  its readiness for class action. A party serving the interests of the
  proletariat must not link its activity with those of the state, it must remain
  in continuous opposition to the state.

  Now we may collect all this together as a scheme for social relations. The
  state administers society, including the aggregate of all proletarians. The
  party monitors the state. The proletariat, the entire class, monitors party
  decisions through embodying them in their own mass activities directed at
  changing the state system. And the other way around; the proletariat transfers
  and delegates to the party its most advanced ideas; the party secures the
  realization of these ideas in state form; the state consolidates the
  establishment of these ideas in society.

  This is the unique scheme for social relations which can secure the existence
  and continuous reproduction of the dictatorship of the proletariat in society.

  In order to assess the disposition of forces corresponding to the dictatorship
  of the proletariat, we must first pause for a deeper examination. In
  distinction from the other components of the proletarian dictatorship, the
  party must always have a precise understanding of its basic aims and tasks at
  each concrete stage. This does not mean that the party must be the brain of
  society. No, the destiny of the party is rather to play the role of a sense
  organ, to keenly apprehend reality and the beginnings of the impulses of the
  mass movement. But before it can be embodied in a definite restructuring, each
  impulse must be comprehended by the super-brain, the consciousness of the
  proletariat; for only its approval can confer reality on the impulse. The
  party, if it deviates from the interests of the proletariat or gets ahead of
  it, will immediately sense this.

  Holding fast to its aim of the construction of communist society, the
  development of social relations in the direction of communism, the party must
  understand the sharp divergence of its own tasks from the tasks of the
  proletarian state.

  Despite the fact that the proletarian state, in general, at the stage of the
  movement toward communism, plays a positive role, and is the only means of
  realization of this movement, every concrete form of the proletarian state, at
  that historical moment, is the most backward element of proletarian
  society. This is because it it is occupied not with the search for newer,
  higher levels, but with the consolidation of a level of social consciousness
  which has already been reached and surpassed. The state, remaining
  proletarian, exhibits its advanced character only in external aspects, only in
  its relations with the non-proletarian environment. In its relations with the
  proletariat it always remains bourgeois because it dies away only to the
  extent that it loses the support of the individualistic hangovers in the
  proletariat itself and in other members of society.

  The party encourages this withering away with all the means at its disposal,
  its ideological work secures definite changes in the consciousness of society
  and the organized movement of the proletariat for consolidation by the state
  of the changes which have take place. The state is incapable of embodying an
  ideology which outstrips the current level in this way; it changes and
  progresses only under pressure from the masses, and it loses its function to
  the extent that the masses transform their consciousness on the path to
  communist social consciousness. The growth of communist social consciousness,
  generally speaking, consists not in the mastery of culture, nor in the
  assimilation of the theory of social development, although all this is useful,
  but quite simply in the predomination of collectivist over individual
  consciousness. But the development of the collectivist interests of each
  member of society depend directly on their level of satisfaction; it flowers
  in victory and withers in defeat. This is where the party and its theoretical
  armaments play a decisive role, securing the selection of paths to victory and
  organizing the masses for victory. Continuous interaction on the basis of
  common interests, alone can guarantee the establishment in each individual of
  the principal communist idea that the social position of the individual is
  determined by the degree of his collectivism. Incidentally, this is why all
  attempts to "implant" communism by the state or by a party-state ruling system
  are futile; one ought not to hope for the development of collectivist
  characteristics from individualistic incentives. To each concrete, historical
  form of the socialist state the masses must liberally offer their recognition
  but not their respect; and it is exactly this the party must worry about,
  crushing conservative complacency with its inexhaustible enthusiasm.

  Even though subordinate to society, the state serves its majority, at the same
  time that advanced ideas, guaranteeing forward movement, arise in the minds of
  a minority. Such ideas can become the property of the whole of society, can
  become the leading ideas of the state only if they are supported by the party
  which, through its ideological activity, makes them into the ideas of the
  majority. Without the organized support of a party no minority ideas will be
  able to stand against a functioning state machine.

  The opposition between the party and the state in socialist society is the
  most direct, most naked reflection of the fundamental contradiction of
  socialism, the contradiction between the communist and the bourgeois, the
  social and the personal, the collectivist and the individualist. In this
  contradiction lies the source of the development toward communism, and the
  more clearly the opposing forces are recognized, the more exactly the causes
  of their opposition, within the concrete historical sequence, are defined, the
  more effectively the process of overcoming these contradictions will proceed
  and the more direct will be the path of society to communism.

  The party and the state present themselves as two structures organizing
  society, two types of social organization; leadership and management. It is as
  if these structures found themselves at opposite poles of social
  life. Management is a coordination of activity, leadership is a coordination
  of consciousness. Management exerts influence on individuality through
  limitations and stimuli, leadership appeals to the understanding and
  influences through public opinion. Management appeals to the individual,
  knowing of no other means of control other than the economic. Leadership
  discloses to the individual the possibility of direct social management, not
  linked with economic circumstances. Management operates on the accumulated
  experience of the past, leadership seeks its support in the future.

  Society serves as the source, continuously nourishing both the party and the
  state. What then will take place?

  The proletariat under the leadership of the party seizes power; thus the
  party, willy-nilly, becomes the ruler. It necessarily must take a decisive
  part in securing the victory of the proletariat, in the liquidation of
  residual capitalist forces, in the destruction of the old and construction of
  the new state apparatus. And the new state apparatus can be composed only of
  party cadre, of people who have proven their dedication to the proletarian
  cause. Where then is the opposition?

  But perhaps things don't need to be this way? No, this is the only way! Shall
  we give up power to the "Varangians"[2] whose aims are so far from
  proletarian? And in general; for the newborn state there is only one
  possibility, one solid buttress for the establishment of power, that is the
  full support of all proletarian layers, cemented together in the party.

  The solution, it would seem, is prefined. And for all that ... The proletarian
  party, in linking itself to the state, only deceives itself about the apparent
  ease of realization of revolutionary aims through the mechanism of the
  state. Such a path can consolidate the victory of the proletariat and its
  mastery over the other classes, but as for the questions of the further
  development of the proletariat itself and of its consciousness, these are
  excluded from the sphere of activity of the party and become inaccessible to
  it. On becoming the ruling class, the party can remain proletarian, but in
  this event it will not be the avant-garde of the proletariat but will
  represent the most backward of its strata.

  To lead the conscious advance of society is possible only for an opposition
  party, basing its work on the appeal to the collectivist character of the
  workers and organizing the proletariat for collective activity as a
  counterweight to the administration, which links society with its system of
  coercive stimuli.

  So what should we have? A two party (or multiparty) system? And will we let
  social contradictions resolve themselves through struggle between the ruling
  and the opposition party?

  But, along this path, the fundamental contradiction of society, the source of
  its development, would be concealed, made more complicated and even pushed
  entirely to the side in the struggle for power; that is to say, secondary
  contradictions would divert much effort, but would in no way, shape or form
  assist in advancing society. Besides which, the existence of many parties
  inevitably assists in the stratification of society and the division of its
  interests, that is, serves to place additional obstacles on the path of the
  transformation of the society to classlessness.

  No, solving the problem of the dictatorship of the proletariat is possible
  only by bursting through the historical (and altogether alien to proletariat)
  precedents, only by liberating oneself from the path of habitual schematism.

  Not the opposition of a ruling and an opposition party, but the immediate
  opposition of the party and the state; this is what fully reveals the social
  contradictions, this is what the proletariat must strive for.

  Yes, the party must lead the proletariat in the struggle for power. Yes, the
  party, at the head of the proletariat must seize this power. Yes, it must
  destroy the old state apparatus and build a new one. It must promote its most
  experienced organizers, leaders and chiefs to the leading posts in the state;
  and then it must immediately cross them off its list of voting members.

  Just that. This does not mean a complete rupture but a radical restructuring
  of relations; thus totally excluding state interference in party affairs and
  the direct influence of state interests on party activity.

  The party must continue to monitor those of its members that have been
  promoted to administrative posts, it must understand their state concerns and
  must prove itself to be a direct help in organizing the masses for the support
  of state measures. But the party must do this, not under the diktat of the
  state, but only as it emerges from its own aims and tasks. It is completely
  natural that this support will be at its most energetic and powerful in the
  early period, when the leading ideas of the party and the state are almost
  completely convergent, when the state is being refounded and needs such
  support most of all. But even in this period the party must not bind itself
  with any promises.

  In detaching its better cadre and leading forces to state posts, the
  proletariat must clearly recognize that this will not resolve all the problems
  of social development. Sooner or later, the interests of the state apparatus
  will be brought into contradiction with the developing interests of the
  proletariat, will become a constraint on the formation of state structures and
  the point of some of their functions will be lost. Then, a new revolution is
  needed which can raise to the state level those changes which have taken place
  in the consciousness of society. Only such an uninterrupted revolutionary
  development can lead to the foundation of a communist society.

  Having taken power from the bourgeoisie at the cost of the lives of its best
  fighters, the proletariat is obliged to take care that in the future, the
  revolution can be continued without bloody struggle. It must deprive the state
  of the possibility of creating any anti-proletarian organizations
  whatsoever. It must constitutionally consolidate for itself rights which
  secure for it paths for the democratic transformation of the state. These
  rights are as follows;

  - the freedom of the self-directed organization of the proletariat and state
    guarantees of these freedoms through the granting of positions within the
    means of mass propaganda and so forth,
  - the prohibition of the direct participation of the servants of the state
    apparatus in social and political organizations,
  - limitations on the self-directed activity of non-proletarian strata.

  But most importantly, the proletariat must never forget, that even though
  enshrined in the constitution, such rights will provide no real guarantee
  without the preparedness of the proletariat itself to defend them in the most
  decisive manner. If the proletariat is unable to defend its freedoms, its
  privileges and its proletarian party, this means that its consciousness is
  still not ripe for socialism. Conversely, if the proletariat is able, without
  concessions, inflexibly, with arms in hand when this is unavoidable, to stand
  up for these rights, then this is precisely what will secure its freedom of
  movement toward communism. Socialism is possible only when the class
  consciousness of the proletariat and its organization have developed the
  readiness to seize power in its own hands at any moment.

  Only by securing the merger of its social and collective interests in the
  activity of the proletarian party, only by maintaining a minimum of
  organization, and this means in opposition to other social layers, will the
  proletariat be able to feel itself master of the situation, able to maintain
  the obedience of the entire state mechanism and able to restructure it to
  whatever extent is necessary.

  Being master of the situation means being in charge of the distribution of
  goods. And although many of the elaborations of this question will,
  unavoidably, be entrusted to the state apparatus, the proletariat must
  recognize that the last word always rests with it; for any state functionary,
  including the highest, may be dismissed from his post and deprived of his
  benefits by the will of the proletariat. Because of the availability to the
  workers of the proletarian party, organizing its mass activities, this right
  ceases to be a fiction and becomes a real means of directing the state.

  For its part, the party, even if it is presented with the opportunity, must
  refuse to take part in the distribution of goods, but must exert the most
  decisive efforts to bring all state activities in this sphere under the
  control of the whole class, the entire proletarian mass. For, if the
  distribution of goods is not controlled by the entire proletariat, it will
  become the booty of a new bourgeoisie, whatever form that might take.

  Thus, the state apparatus, at least its key parts, must be composed of people
  previously schooled in party organizational work. They must be monitored by
  the party in all their activities and must bear direct responsibility to the
  ruling class, the proletariat. The party too must be formed immediately out of
  the proletarian mass. And it must fulfill the following condition.

  The party is the highest form of the self-directed organization of the
  proletariat. Service to the proletariat must be for the party not just its
  leading idea, but also the sole requirement of its members, upon the
  satisfaction of which their continued membership depends. While the state
  serves the proletariat, being stimulated by the share of the goods allotted to
  it, for the party service to the proletariat is both the aim and the
  stimulus. Correspondingly, they serve it differently.

  Serving the proletariat, satisfying its present needs, conforming to its
  present interests and creating for it the conditions for its cultural and
  creative development, these are the obligations of the state.

  The party has other tasks.

  Tirelessly, both in word and in deed, it must clarify to the proletariat that
  its present interests are false interests; that they weigh it down with the
  ancient baggage of feudal and bourgeois history, and that they in no way
  correspond to the forward looking possibilities of society. It must clarify
  that what the proletariat justly demands from life, which they themselves can
  build, will be vastly better.

  It must help the proletariat to utilize the opportunities for cultural
  development which are available to it for real cultural development; that is
  for association, for decisive influence in the shaping, by humanity, of the
  general system for understanding the world and for the mastery of the enormous
  possibilities of human society.

  It must cultivate out of the proletariat's present interests its future
  interests. It must enrich the spirit of mutual trust and collectivism, ever
  more directly pointing out the dependence of the social situation on social
  and not economic factors.

  It must act as the organizer of the mass struggle for revolutionary social
  change, for the embodyment of what is new and advanced in state forms and for
  inculcation in the minds and opinions of the mass; that is for the
  transformation of future interests into the reality of today.

  In order to cope with these tasks, the party must be composed not of people
  who once demonstrated their ability to serve the proletariat, but rather of
  people who prove it with their every motion, each day of their lives. For this
  the party must not only be able to attract into its ranks the rich enthusiasm
  of youth, but must be able to free itself from individual, conservative
  encrustations.

  The party must cleanse itself, not only of those who live in bygone days, but
  also of those who are mired in the present. For them, the time has come to
  turn from ideological work to the practical implementation of their own ideas,
  and the party must push them on to state work, simultaneously liberating
  itself from their influence.

  True, in contemporary society, it is not everyone, even among workers, that is
  capable of dedicating their entire lives and all their efforts to unselfish
  service to the proletariat. But, in the life of almost everyone, there is a
  period when the social predominates over the personal, when their activities
  are dictated by collective interests and not by personal advantage. It is
  precisely in this period that their self-motivation must be united in the
  party, in the framework of resolving party problems.

  It is only then, when the consciousness of a human being has risen above its
  prejudices and biological instincts, only in the period of its highest
  spiritual elevation, it is only then that the individual is worthy of
  membership in the party, is suitable for party work, capable, together with
  the party, of placing before society the problems of the future. But the party
  cannot rely upon lifelong enthusiasm, and this is why no one can be guaranteed
  lifelong trust.

  Party work is not the sole capacity in which society may be served; the state
  presents the citizen with another form of service, one encouraged by the
  satisfaction of personal needs. Those who have outlived their elevation, in
  whom the individualistic has prevailed, the party must exile from its
  activities; exile without reproach but with respect and recognition of merit;
  pityless exile, yet not a severing of all ties.

  And at the head of the list of those who must be exiled from party affairs,
  are those whose work is linked to the taking of state decisions, for in
  proletarian society there is not a single internal problem to which the party
  and the state would adopt a uniform solution. The development of social
  consciousness also includes the recognition that each individual resolves such
  contradictions for himself, in his own consciousness, and that no one may
  resolve them for him, at the state level.

  Solutions, proposed by the party and taken up individually by the majority of
  proletarian society, are revolutionary transformations, changes in the
  consciousness of each individual; at the same time they mark a definite break
  in social, class consciousness. The renewal of the class consciousness of the
  proletariat finds a concrete form of expression, being reflected, in a most
  precise and concentrated way, in the consciousness of individual leaders. In
  this way, new class interests again express themselves through ideas; they are
  defined by historical conditions and penetrate the individual consciousness of
  workers. Such ideas have a decisive organizational significance through the
  mobilization of the proletariat for cooperative activity aimed at the
  achievement of class aims.

  Ideas formulated by the leaders reflect class requirements, they are not
  identical with the interests engendered by the objective reality in separate
  individuals, and this is why they cannot be taken as a certain kind of
  personal program and are adopted only with the recognition of personal
  dependence on the collective and collective activity. The ideas of the leaders
  do not penetrate the consciousness of each individual at once. Each time they
  need to be pushed through, along one and the same difficult path, overcoming
  the usual barrier of individualism and cracking the shell of conservative
  complacency. At the start, they are adopted only by those who are the most
  receptive, and through them receive a much broader dissemination. The essence
  of the matter is that the immediate dissemination of ideas in society is
  generally impossible; society is sufficiently conservative and indifferent to
  novelty that in it any idea can wither. But once apprehended, even if only by
  a very small minority, advanced ideas lead this minority to action, and then
  this very movement of the minority disturbs the slumbers of society, which
  then must define its relationship to events one way or another and this leads
  it to activity. Thus the activity broadens, spreads and disperses the ideas in
  its wake.

  The dissemination of ideas is accompanied by their concretization and, what is
  especially important, the concretization of the forms of activity linked to
  them. They become ever more definite, the forms of ideas embodied in activity
  acquire the character of a social movement, they become consolidated in the
  form of traditions accepted into the consciousness of society and require
  recognition and legitimation by the state. The requirements of society from
  the state change, and this entails changes in the policy of the state, changes
  in its structure, and leaders, linked to the new forms of social
  consciousness, are promoted.

  And so, in creating a continuous revolutionary pulse in society, promoting new
  leaders and new ideas, with new forms of social movement emerging and being
  consolidated, there must be cooperation between the party and the state. In
  the continuous renewal of the state apparatus, its restructuring, that is to
  say, the incessant renewal of its composition and structure, the party plays
  its decisive role in the development of the revolutionary dictatorship of the
  proletariat.

  But in examining the relations between the proletariat, its party and the
  state, have we not forgotten that the state is a particular organized force
  for suppression and compulsion? Here, everything will be clear when we examine
  the state as the means of realization of the dictatorship of the proletariat
  over other classes. But the state also remains the state in its relations with
  the proletariat itself; and here the question is not so simple.

  Representing the interests of the proletariat as a class, its social
  interests, as opposed to the aggregate of the individualistic interest of all
  proletarians, the state utilizes all its means of compulsion directly to that
  end. Clearly, even when we are speaking of stimuli, incentives and bonuses for
  the fulfillment by members of society of definite conditions, the heart of the
  matter remains the same as for compulsion, which is only the limitation of
  access to goods for those members of society that do not fulfill these
  definite conditions. If we take into consideration that the stimuli give
  access to definite resources, supplying the individual with his livelihood,
  while the compulsions are the threat of partial or total withdrawal of access
  to these resources, then it is clear that, in the relations between society
  and the individual, there is no difference between them. Since the basis of
  socialist society is the stimulation of the activities of individuals in the
  interests of society as a whole, it is quite obvious that the state has the
  need for definite means of compulsion, of force, permitting the establishment
  of definite limits.

  But, possessed of a force suitable for the compulsion of society as a whole,
  the state has the opportunity to alienate itself from society, placing itself
  above it. Moreover, the history of the 20th century offers numerous cases in
  which the army placed itself above society, formed a new state and transferred
  power to another class.

  How can the proletariat avoid such a danger?

  History proves that, having brought about a revolution, the army cannot
  transfer power to just any class, but only to one of the most organized
  classes, reinforcing it with its organized support. This means that one of the
  guarantees consists in ensuring that the organization of the proletariat
  within the socialist state is incomparably higher than that of other
  classes. For this the proletariat must not only limit the self-directed
  organization of other classes, but, and this is most important, their
  utilization (with the aim of organizing) of the economic resources
  inaccessible to the proletariat. This secures not only a weakening, but also
  the gradual destruction of all classes opposed to the proletariat and reliably
  defends the proletariat from internal enemies, except for the state itself.

  The socialist state is a sufficiently powerful and sufficiently bourgeois
  organization, that it can, through its striving to isolate itself, through its
  utilization of the forces under its control, turn into an independent class,
  into a new bourgeoisie. The unique reliable guarantee against this is a
  situation in which the forces of the state are composed only of the armed
  people, the armed proletariat. But while the state itself is essential, so too
  is it essential that this must be a state organized arming of the people. And
  this is not altogether the same thing as the simple arming of the people; it
  presupposes its use with the aim of organizing the distribution of goods by
  the state, i.e. becoming an organized force immediately dependent on the
  state.

  No simple recipe for addressing this problem can be given. Here lurks a real
  difficulty, arising from the contradiction in the situation of a socialist
  country encircled by capitalism. However this does not mean that the problem
  is insoluble, but only that the solution cannot be found at the level of
  principle but at the level of concrete organizational forms, taking into
  consideration all the specifics of the level of development of social
  consciousness.

  It must be kept in mind that in all external questions, questions of the
  mutual relations with other states and internal non-proletarian strata, the
  interests of the socialist state and the proletariat coincide completely.

  Therefore, clearly, the institution of political commissars in the army, which
  was an unavoidable outcome of the Civil War in Russia, lost its significance
  in external wars.

  Therefore, the attention of the proletariat must be concentrated on control
  over the army, and, especially in situations of internal conflict, over the
  organs of internal affairs and political security. The position of the
  proletarian party, the interests of the party in all internal questions,
  coincide with the interests of the proletariat. However, it does not follow
  that this coincidence of interests, in both internal and external questions,
  allows for the immediate subordination of the forces of repression to the
  party. Such a subordination would provoke a change in the interests of the
  party, it would lead to their "stateifcation." But it is in questions of
  control over the armed forces that the proletariat can completely trust the
  party, just as in questions of control over the state in general.

  Various measures can be taken with aim of facilitating such control. For
  example, the decentralization of control of the armed forces in correspondence
  with the immediacy of the external threat, stricter accountability of the
  internal organs in activities affecting the interests of the proletariat, and
  so forth; all such measures of an organizational nature, and their alteration
  at each concrete stage, must be determined by the extent to which they are
  essential for the maintenance of the supremacy of the proletariat, in
  proportion to the internal and external dangers.

  The history of the Soviet Union, where for the period of proletarian
  dictatorship such problems did not give rise to insoluble difficulties, proves
  that, as long as it is economically beyond the control of the capitalist
  encirclement, a socialist country is capable, for a sufficient time, and
  possibly for as long as you like, of containing these contradictions in the
  construction of the state; for they weaken and die away the more that the
  organization of the proletariat and its organized influence on society grow.

* Classes and the struggle for socialism
  Classes are those groups of people between whom all the productive forces of
  society are divided. On this basis the production relations between classes
  are formed. With the appearance of owners of a certain fraction of the
  productive forces, arises the possibility of their influencing all movement of
  the social product and their exploitation of this resource in the struggle
  with other classes for social position. The very existence of classes is
  linked to the existence of private property in productive forces (not just the
  means of production) and this is why, quite apart from the existence of barter
  or commodity-money relations, the significance of any particular productive
  force varies and the roles of the classes vary correspondingly with particular
  classes obtaining supremacy over the rest.

  In conditions of commodity-money relations, social position is wholely and
  completely defined by economic circumstances, that is the share of social
  wealth appropriated and distributed by the given class. The classes struggle
  amongst themselves over this.

  The productive forces include three fundamental elements; the earth and all
  its natural wealth, the means of production, which are congealed, dead labour,
  and labour power. Historical changes in production methods and the
  corresponding changes in socio-economic formations are constrained by the
  level of organization and the organizing influence of these elements on
  society.

  Apart from the classes in society, there are people who do not enter the
  production process in the capacity of owners, who do not contribute any of
  their property to social production. These can be divided into groups
  according to their social role; intelligentsia, army, lumpen proletariat and
  so forth. All of them, in one way or another, necessarily serve such classes
  as are able to allot to them the share of goods essential for their existence,
  i.e. chiefly such classes as are, at the current moment, in a commanding
  position. Despite the fact that their indirect influence on production can
  have colossal significance for society, despite the definite internal
  organization of such social groups, these groups do not play a decisive role
  in the development of society since they lack the organic unity of interests
  which is distinctive of a class. Historically, all attempts of such social
  groups to influence the development of society led, after the appropriation of
  some part of the productive forces, to their becoming a class or rising into
  the class which they were, perhaps unconsciously, serving. This is precisely
  why the social interests of such groups are always vague and do not form a
  socially significant unity.

  The class policy of the victorious proletariat is defined, in the first place,
  by the circumstances under which they achieved victory. In other words, it is
  essential that the level of development of the productive forces and the
  corresponding class composition of society be taken into account.

  As a rule, it is joint action of the proletariat and the peasants and petty
  bourgeois which result in the achievement of power. However, if in this union
  the proletariat does not have decisive supremacy, then the revolution will not
  have a socialist character, it will remain bourgeois-democratic.

  The authentic victory of the proletariat, the socialist revolution, always
  means the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The union of
  the proletariat with the peasants and other layers of society can have no
  other content, for the term of this dictatorship, than the requirement of the
  proletariat for the functioning of these layers. This requirement lasts only
  for the period in which the wholeness of this complex of functions remains
  essential for the existence of society.

  The policy of the proletariat in relation to other classes and layers is
  entirely dictated by the necessity of stimulating socially necessary activity
  in them; it is linked with the organizational forms borrowed from the
  capitalists of old, to the extent that this is necessary to secure the clarity
  and effectiveness of these stimuli. But simultaneously, the proletariat and
  its state must nurture those stimuli contradicting the obsolete forms; thus
  smashing them and directing the development of all layers into socialist
  channels.

  Here the complete expropriation of the exploiters has a decisive significance;
  it destroys the psychological dependency of the individual's social position
  on capital, on his private property. But, having been once carried through to
  completion, the process of expropriation must not cease. Commodity-money
  relations inevitably give rise to a tendency to enrichment; and this means
  that the struggle against these tendencies, in all their modes of existence,
  is unavoidable. One of the most important tasks is the inculcation of the idea
  that personal wealth, however it is constituted, does not guarantee the
  consolidation of social position, but on the contrary, its instability. This
  objective, naturally, contradicts the construction of socialist society's most
  important relations on a purely bourgeois basis. For in retaining bourgeois
  relation, socialist society has no intention of increasing their stability;
  just as capitalism itself gives no guarantee against destruction or capitalist
  competition and so forth. At the same time, the retention of bourgeois
  relations demands of socialist society the drawing-up of the plan of attack
  against them.

  These are the most complicated questions of the internal policy of the
  dictatorship of the proletariat. The movement of the whole of socialist
  society toward communism depends, to a very significant extent, on the
  correctness of their resolution at each historical step. And, in the first
  place, this is linked to the construction of relations with such classes as
  the peasants and such strata as the intelligentsia.

  But before we can examine the question of the peasantry, it is absolutely
  essential to investigate relations between the proletariat and the
  intelligentsia.

  What distinguishes the intelligentsia, working for hire, from the hired
  worker?

  The economic essence of the distinction, we have already established; the
  intelligentsia does not sell labour power, it sells its monopoly of
  knowledge. But the boundary between physical and mental labour has long since
  lost its previous precision. How then are we to separate the activities of
  workers from those of the intelligentsia in practice.

  Let us take the more precise category, reproductive labour.

  Reproductive labour is the creation, with the help of well-known means of
  production and techniques, of things which, for all practical purposes, are
  identical with similar things produced in the past.

  Reproductive labour can be simple or complex; more complex labour demands
  higher qualifications and more developed skills. It is precisely the
  reproductive labour which constitutes the value of any given thing. That is,
  the value of any commodity is the minimum social necessary labour required for
  its reproduction with the contemporary methods and at the contemporary level
  of development of the productive forces.

  Practically everything which humanity consumes in the material realm is the
  result of such reproductive labour. Thus reproductive labour possesses a
  decisive significance for the existence and reproduction of humanity.

  Creative, as opposed to reproductive, labour appears in the form of a wide
  variety of activities, which, however, are not connected with the immediate
  reproduction of things. In this sense, creativity appears in the mastery of
  the skills of reproductive labour, in organizational activity and in the
  creation of new technology; it is simply the social significance of these that
  is different.

  Those who live on payment for creative labour, including a definite category
  of people performing physical labour, among them workers, but who are
  evaluated and rewarded based on their capabilities for discovering unique
  technological solutions, are not proletarians. From among them the
  intelligentsia is formed and this is a particular social stratum.

  Reproductive labour is the curse of mankind. Day and night humanity brings its
  influence to bear on the planet. Its labour has one single object; it destroys
  one thing, creates another and in so doing changes the conditions of its own
  existence, all to secure the resources for the satisfaction of its needs.

  Reproductive labour, the reproduction of the articles of consumption, creates
  our food, clothing, housing, heat and light and those material forms, through
  whose mediation, we satisfy our spiritual needs; reproductive labour
  reproduces the machines which are needed to create articles for consumption,
  and also such machines as are needed to reproduce the former. Reproductive
  labour changes the world, inside and out. With the value created by this
  labour, there is a change in value of the planet as source of livelihood for
  all humanity, taking account of both consuming and producing subjects; in the
  not too distant future, precisely this will become the basis of humanity's
  political economy.

  Reproductive labour is the source of the existence of humanity, the basis of
  the life of the mind on earth.

  Mankind does not simply want to exist, but wishes to live ever better and
  better, and for this purpose was given intellect and consciousness, that vast,
  ideal force, capable of purposeful, coordinated mobilization of all physical
  forces. And driven by history, moving from stage to stage, humanity conducts
  its internal struggle to make the most intelligent use of its physical forces.

  Creative labour, ever more organized and enriched by experience, is ever more
  active in influencing reproductive labour and so lightens and perfects it. It
  is also true that significant creative effort is directed to the opposite, the
  struggle for and defense of private (whether individual, group or class)
  interests, thus atomizing and negating itself in petty struggle. Liberating
  all this tremendous creative energy from internecine struggle, and putting it
  to work for the benefit of society, is in the interests of mankind. But this
  cannot be achieved by means of utopian "reasoned agreement," it must be
  achieved by smashing all private interests, which is possible only by the
  complete subordination of creative labour to the tasks of reproductive labour,
  that is as a consequence of proletarian dictatorship. And here the point, of
  course, is not that all creative activity be subordinated to the applied aim
  of lightening reproductive labour, but rather that this aim, in the most
  general way, defines the highest humanistic content of all creativity.

  The task for all humanity is to get the most complete agreement of its
  intellect with its powers; this defines the relations between the proletariat
  and the intelligentsia, the character of the development of their relations.

  The intelligentsia as the concentrated social intellect, has existed from time
  immemorial. The social essence of humanity, that which separates it from the
  animal, lies in intellect and consciousness; thus it is unsurprising that the
  abilities of some people to generalize facts and to think abstractly
  distinguishes these people from the general mass, and defines their particular
  position in society. This particular position has not always been and will not
  always be the position of superiors in relation to the rest; it simply
  distinguishes them from the rest in the aggregate of their relations with
  society.

  A great period in the life of human society, including several social
  formations, can be characterised by the fact that the members of society found
  their social position to be completely dependent on their economic
  position. For almost the entire duration of this period, intellect, the
  ability to think abstractly, played a secondary role, and it was only at the
  last stage, under capitalist socio-economic formations, that its situation
  changed essentially. And, what is more, this was not a direct recognition of
  the social significance of intellect, it signified only that intellect had
  matured into an active influence on economic position, and capitalism was
  quick to notice this, taking intellect into its service. The intelligentsia
  became an important factor in the capitalist competitive struggle and indeed
  an object of such struggle.

  The economic recognition of capitalism, the growing competition for the
  purchase of intellect and the revelation of its secrets, grew into social
  recognition, recognition through economic position. But this secondary status
  always tortures the intelligentsia, for they would prefer a society where
  intellect would be recognized for its own sake, where it would be considered
  as social property. But in so far as the majority of the intelligentsia is
  unable to accommodate to this separation of social from economic recognition,
  they are thrown into a wilderness of utopian fantasy, believing themselves to
  have mastery of both mind and matter. The fact that humanities best minds
  succeeded in breaking free of such eclecticism and directly comprehended the
  connection between this contradiction and the basic contradiction of
  capitalist society, finally recognizing both their place within society, and
  the fact that this situation must lead to the transformation of the class
  position of the proletariat, does not resolve the question for the whole
  intelligentsia. There is no solidarity of the intelligentsia in its pursuit of
  recognition.

  The struggle of the proletariat and its social activism always attracts a
  fraction of the intelligentsia to its side.

  Some immediately regard the power of the proletariat as a means for the
  achievement of their own ends. These are the liberals who flirt with the
  proletariat.

  Others arrive in the proletarian ranks as equals among equals. But later this
  becomes, 'We are the more educated among equals, to us falls the
  responsibility of defining the aims and choosing the paths.' From these arise
  endless opportunists who lead the proletariat for their own ends.

  Some choose to serve the proletariat unconditionally. To help the proletariat
  become conscious of its own aims, to light with the torch of theory the
  proletariat's path forward in order that it will not be mistaken in its choice
  of the proletarian path; these are the tasks they set themselves.

  With this last group the proletariat can march to victory.

  And afterwards? Having established its hegemony, the victorious proletariat
  requires the activity of the entire intelligentsia. But this will be
  impossible without casualties. The flames of revolution inflame hegemonist
  strivings in a part of the intelligentsia and incite them to corresponding
  activity. This fraction must become the object of proletarian terror. And
  clearly, the remaining fraction will have no intentions of working for the
  proletariat for free, just for the sake of it.

  The proletariat as a class, as the sole owner of the means of production, and
  this means as a capitalist in its relations with other strata, must also act
  as a capitalist. It must hire as many of the intelligentsia as are necessary,
  and under conditions, as far as is possible, no worse than those offered by
  the bourgeoisie.

  It can also hire some fraction of the bourgeoisie, maintaining an appearance
  of capitalist profit in determining their pay. The proletariat must rationally
  organize all the creative resources of society.

  As dictator, the proletariat must decisively refuse political recognition to
  all members of the intelligentsia hired under bourgeois conditions. Taking
  upon itself the defence of the right of individuals in their individual
  relations with non-proletarian strata, the proletariat must leave these
  strata, in their relations with the proletarian state, no more than the
  appearance of whatever their rights might have been.

  All of this flows naturally from the interests of the proletariat. All of it
  arises naturally from the indefinite, unstable situation of the
  intelligentsia. The more distinctly the hollow victories of the intelligentsia
  in the proletarian revolution are revealed, the more precisely and definitely
  they are pointed out, the more the groundlessness of utopian hopes will be
  clarified to the intelligentsia.

  That the contradictions in the minds of the intelligentsia are expressions of
  the contradictions of capitalism must be revealed under socialism with the
  utmost clarity, and must compel the intelligentsia to sharply rethink its
  place in society. These contradictions must push the intelligentsia into
  motion, must nudge it forward. But toward what?

  Creative labour is a need for all human beings. Each regularly turns to
  creative activity. And when the results of this creativity acquire a social
  significance, this need becomes still more imperative, for in uniting it is
  weighted with a heightening of personal social significance.

  Reproductive labour is essential. It realizes itself as a social necessity and
  it occurs only with the realization of each individual participant of his
  inseparability from society. The intelligentsia must also realize this, but
  this can only come about through the feeling that the social position of the
  working class is higher than its own and that the difference cannot be
  compensated for by the receipt of material goods.

  It is impossible to accelerate this process through economic pressure,
  although the proletarian authorities always have this possibility
  available. The proletariat, under all conditions, remains an open class, and
  this, its merit, conceals definite dangers.

  Exerting pressure on the intelligentsia, the proletariat can compel them to
  join its own ranks; and thus be left without an intelligentsia, like a blind
  man without a guide. This is why it is necessary to speak to the
  intelligentsia in the language of bourgeois privilege. Yet the proletariat can
  not maintain such a situation for ever. What must it counterpose to it?

  The proletariat must promote its own intelligentsia. The point here is
  certainly not that this must be an intelligentsia of proletarian origin, but
  rather that this intelligentsia must provide society with its labour free of
  charge, without any economic stimulus; satisfying itself only with social
  recognition and such goods as it receives from its own reproductive labour. If
  this cannot be a lifelong commitment, then let it be for a definite period,
  after which this intelligentsia may, if it wishes, take up the position of the
  bourgeois intelligentsia, losing its social privileges and gaining economic
  ones. But let it carry with it a nostalgia for the respect of its class
  brothers.

  And then the rising effectiveness of production, leading to the lowering of
  norms for reproductive labour, together with the growth of the material
  well-being of the proletariat will complete these beginnings and the new
  intelligentsia will, in general, not wish to break its links with the
  proletariat, with reproductive labour. The intelligentsia will then cease to
  exist as a social group, intellect will fully become a property of the
  proletariat and creative labour will be done according to ability. It stands
  to reason that this can occur no sooner than the supply of such labour exceeds
  the demand of proletarian society for it.

  Now that the tendency in the development of relations between the proletariat
  and the intelligentsia has been depicted with sufficient clarity, it is easier
  to present the movement in relations with the peasantry.

  It is only from the outside that the work of the peasantry appears to have a
  reproductive content. Of course, ploughing, sowing, weeding, harvesting crops,
  bringing in fertilizer and watering; is labour of a purely reproductive
  character. But all this must be done at an appropriate time and to an
  appropriate extent. And the time and extent must be determined depending on
  fluctuations in the meteorological conditions, and this is a purely creative
  labour. Agriculture concerns itself with living nature, and must always,
  creatively, track its demands and comply with them. It is much harder to
  separate creative from reproductive labour in this case than it is for
  industrial production.

  Yet there is no other way. Here too, creative work must be separated from
  reproductive work, for only in separation can it acquire the social breadth
  which is essential to the new society.

  The development of agronomy and zootechnics, with the maximal
  industrialization of agriculture, leading to the most complete liberation from
  the necessity of individual creativity and the sharpest separation of the
  agricultural intelligentsia from the agricultural proletariat, this is the
  direction in which proletarian efforts must lead. And, although it is obvious
  that the separation of creative labour and its return to the proletariat will
  be most sharply expressed here, in comparison with industry, yet without this
  all management will be impossible.

  The clear-cut separation of the agricultural proletariat from the
  intelligentsia and its merging with the industrial proletariat may also
  suggest new forms of reproductive labour, taking into consideration the
  non-seasonal work of industry and the seasonal character of agriculture. But
  independent of this, the industrialization of agriculture remains one of the
  most important tasks of the industrial proletariat, of the dictatorship of the
  proletariat, because without this the economic limitations cannot be overcome,
  the general level of effectiveness of production which can completely resolve
  the economic problems of society will not be achieved. This is why the
  technical and economic tasks of the proletariat in relations with the
  countryside converge with its fundamental direction. Here it is particularly
  important that, though the technical course of industrialization, of course,
  has enormous importance, it must not push the political tasks into the
  background. Without serious attention to the political tasks, even in the
  search for technical solutions, the ancient traditions will not be overcome,
  and this means that the divisions between town and country can not be
  eliminated. The town must bring to agriculture, with all possible precision,
  its industrial thinking, only thus liberating the natural attraction of
  humanity to the land from feudal and bourgeois stratifications.

  Are the tasks of the proletariat, in relation to the peasantry and the
  intelligentsia, continuations of the class struggle carried over from
  capitalist society?

  Yes, but it is not here that we ought to search for the focal point. The
  proletariat carries the quintessence of its struggle with the bourgeoisie
  through the boundary of the socialist revolution. This basic contradiction
  ought to be seen from the following perspective; on the one hand, the
  collective, collectivist strivings of the proletariat, and on the other, the
  extreme individualism embodied by the bourgeoisie in the economic privileges
  of private property and the establishment of a direct dependency of social
  position on economic position. Yet capitalist society produces individualistic
  strivings for social privilege not only in the bourgeoisie, but in all strata
  and classes of society. And the proletariat, having liquidated the bourgeoisie
  as a class, and private property as the foundation of economic privilege,
  which serves as the basis for the acquisition of many social privileges,
  cannot completely eliminate all striving for individual privileges; for all
  society, even without the bourgeoisie, including the proletarian masses
  themselves is permeated through and through with such strivings.

  The fundamental contradiction of socialism becomes the contradiction between
  the individual and society. The essence of the contradiction is that the
  individual, in opposition to the interests of society, strives for the
  conquest of some individual privilege, strives to receive from society more
  than he himself has given. But then the backward, moribund side of the
  contradiction arises from the individual, from each member of society, whereas
  the advanced side comes from society and is bound up with the collective,
  proletarian class interests. Yet neither side can be annihilated in the
  struggle, for this would mean social suicide.

  Moreover, society, the proletariat, cannot solve its economic problems without
  stimulating the activity of members through the provision of definite
  privileges. This supports the individual struggle for privileges and does not
  allow them to die away. Society must provide the greatest privileges where the
  most important problems of the concrete historical stage are to be
  decided. Supplying privileges permits the effective solution of problems, but,
  simultaneously, society seeks other collective solutions to such problems and
  finds them. Thus the foundation is laid for the negation of previous
  privileges.

  In the course of social development, the dictates of this development produce
  a concentration of privileges in definite strata. And when society discovers
  alternative solutions to these problems, it inevitably comes out in favour of
  the liquidation of previous privileges. This is when new flash-points for
  social struggle flare up, where the side defending its privileges is in fact
  defending nothing other than its bourgeois right to these privileges,
  i.e. comes forward as the successor in the bourgeois cause in this
  continuation of the class battle.

  The rise of such aggravations of the class struggle is inevitable on all paths
  from capitalism to communism, and, in overcoming the resistance of the
  privileged strata, there must be an uninterrupted revolution which alone can
  lead to the development of communist consciousness. Naturally, it is only the
  dictatorship of the proletariat, the dictatorship of an open class, which
  provides privileges equally to all (or, which comes to the same thing, the
  absence of all privilege) which can guarantee that it will consistently reveal
  all obstacles along the path of social development, uncompromisingly struggle
  against them in all areas and so bring about victory in the struggle.

  -----

  History taught us to struggle for the dictatorship of the proletariat and to
  achieve it. History also teaches us to extract lessons from defeat. Where the
  capitalists can not cope with the armed power of the proletariat, they conceal
  themselves, and trying to sprout again, cling to the smallest privileges. They
  deceive and make fools of the workers, trying to regain everything they have
  lost. The proletariat must not hope that such people and forces can save them
  from the rebirth of capitalism. Only its own vigilance can serve as a
  guarantee. The proletariat must not put its faith in its own best
  representatives, for, divided from the class, they begin to act in accordance
  with their own individual powers. The proletariat must not trust even the
  party it gave birth to when it holds power; power is such a privilege that
  only the proletariat itself will not be corrupted and bourgeoisified by
  it. Only the continuous readiness of the whole class, acting in defence of its
  rights and privileges, if necessary with arms in hand, only continuous class
  control over all social processes, only eternal enthusiasm and initiative of
  the proletarian organizations can provide hegemony for the proletariat. This
  is why, while not withdrawing the appeal for the unity of the proletarians of
  all countries, we proclaim that the key slogan of our time is:

  *"HAIL THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT!"*

  established themselves near Novgorod. Their domination lasted only two years,
  after which the locals, who had age old free and democratic traditions, rose
  in rebellion.
